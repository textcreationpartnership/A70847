            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <p>THESE twenty five years and more, you have <hi>reaped</hi> where you <hi>sowed</hi> not, and <hi>gather'd</hi> where you never <hi>scatter'd,</hi> like that <hi>hard man</hi> in the Parable, (<hi>Matt.</hi> 25.24.) whose Example I know not by what Authority you follow; as if you purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed not only to cross the Proverb <hi>(Ʋt sementem feceris, ita &amp; metes)</hi> of mowing as you sow; but those old <hi>Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Constitutions</hi> likewise, which no less than three years since you received a taste of in a short <hi>material Answer</hi> to a long <hi>formal Libel;</hi> tho' you have not thought fit all this while to let me know how you like them.</p>
            <p>If you please to look into<note n="*" place="margin">Lib. <hi>3.</hi> Tit. <hi>22.</hi> de Cens. &amp; Procurat. cap. Quamvis Lex naturae.</note>
               <hi>Lindwood,</hi> you will find your self obliged to a <hi>diligent, personal and effectual scrutiny</hi> of things belonging to your Ecclesiastical Cognizance and Jurisdiction; barr'd from receiving <hi>Proxies,</hi> without doing your duty in the manner there described, and bound to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>store the <hi>Wages</hi> you have taken, without doing the <hi>Work</hi> for which alone it ought to be paid. Touching a <hi>Chappel depending</hi> (which is part of the Controversie that gave oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion to the penning of what is here presented to your view) you will find your self <hi>(Ibid.)</hi> threaten'd with Suspension <hi>ab officio &amp; beneficio,</hi> until you have paid double to the <hi>Mother-Church</hi> for what hath been extorted from the <hi>Daughter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The same Author will tell you that anciently it was judged to be <hi>(Absurdum simul &amp; iniquum ibi quenquam, ubi non seminat, metere; &amp; ex his colligere quae non spar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>git,)</hi>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:37307:3"/> both <hi>absurd</hi> and <hi>unjust</hi> to do as (for divers years past) you have done: with a great deal more which in <hi>Otho's</hi> and <hi>Othobon's Constitutions</hi> you may meet with to rectifie your <hi>Judgment</hi> (if need be) as well as practice. In a special manner I commend to your consideration those words of <hi>Otho,</hi> in the Chapter which concerns Archdeacons: <hi>Sint autem soliciti frequenter interesse Capitulis per singulos Decanatus, in quibus diligenter instruant Sacerdotes—</hi>not omitting <hi>Othobon</hi>'s Repetition of them, <hi>cap. Deus Omnipotens, &amp;c.</hi> where he tells you thus: <hi>Praecepit etiam (praefatus Legatus, i. e. Otho) ut dicti Archidiaconi Capitulis per singulos Decana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus frequenter intersint, in quibus diligenter instruant Sacerdotes.</hi> —For if those passages had been well observed and regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, your Libel, I suppose, (by which you claim to be paid for what you never did) had been omitted. But think not to baffle and confound all this and much more (which in the places pointed at you may read at your leisure) by the bare pronunciation of <hi>Consuetudo:</hi> Besides which, these three or four years wherein the Controversie has been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending, I could never hear any thing pleaded in justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of your claiming <hi>Proxies and Synodies,</hi> tho' you <hi>visit</hi> not according to the <hi>Old or New Canons.</hi> This, it seems, is your <hi>Diana;</hi> but the <hi>Idol,</hi> I trust, will hereafter do you as little service, as that which was once so much extold at <hi>Ephesus.</hi> For what is <hi>Consuetudo</hi> good for, if it be not <hi>ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nabilis, quae nec divino juri contradicit, nec obviat Canonicis In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutis?</hi> As you know what Law defines a good Custom to be, which hath also told you <hi>Consuetudo sine veritate est antiquitas Erroris,</hi> that <hi>Custom</hi> which is contrary to Truth is at best but Antiquity of Error.</p>
            <p>Some have gotten a <hi>Custom of stealing:</hi> Is it therefore no sin to be a <hi>Thief?</hi> Some have a <hi>Custom of lying:</hi> Will that excuse them for not speaking <hi>truth?</hi> It is too well known how <hi>customary</hi> it hath long been to <hi>drink without grace or measure:</hi> Doth this prove that 'tis no fault to be <hi>drunk?</hi> There are <hi>customary Swearers:</hi> Are they any thing the less and not the greater Sinners the oftner they <hi>take the Lord's Name in vain?</hi> There's a <hi>Custom of saying</hi> one thing, and <hi>doing</hi> another: Doth this make <hi>perfidious Promisers</hi> to be no Offenders? A Custom of <hi>Double-dealing:</hi> Is <hi>Hypocrisie</hi>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:37307:3"/> therefore excusable? A Custom of <hi>Loving in word and tongue only:</hi> May we thence conclude that it is not our duty <hi>to love in deed and in truth?</hi> 1 John 3.18.</p>
            <p>The Jews had a <hi>Custom</hi> by which they claimed the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>largement of what Prisoner they pleased to have set at liberty at their <hi>Feast of Passover,</hi> Matt. 27.15. Could this excuse their importunate Clamor to have a <hi>Murtherer ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitted,</hi> and the <hi>greatest Innocent</hi> (that ever suffer'd) con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned? Have not some a <hi>Custom</hi> of putting away (or neglecting) their <hi>Wives</hi> and keeping <hi>Whores?</hi> Will this justifie <hi>Adultery?</hi> And what if others (as if <hi>Matrimony</hi> were a mere <hi>indifferent Church-Ceremony</hi> of man's Invention, and not <hi>an Ordinance of Divine Institution</hi>) are wont to be as intimate with one another <hi>before</hi> as <hi>after</hi> Marriage? Is there nothing culpable in their <hi>antedated, antenuptial Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarity?</hi> Let your Brother Dr. (such a one as he is) the Rector of <hi>Leucolithia</hi> (if you know the place) prove if he can, that not long after the Death of a former Wife, he did better, and not just as I have said.</p>
            <p>You have long (too long) had <hi>a Custom of receiving Temporals without sowing Spirituals.</hi> Is it reasonable to do it still? If you think so because it makes for your ease, and tends to your profit; Let me here urge that known <hi>Rule</hi> of the Civil Law, [<hi>Non firmatur tractu temporis quod de Jure ab initio non subsistit:</hi> Or as you your self have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced it, Pag. 98. of <hi>Roma ruit: Quod ab initio fuit invali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum, tractu temporis non convalescit.</hi>] That length of time makes nothing firm which originally was <hi>feeble or faulty.</hi> (For so it hath otherwise been worded: <hi>Quod ab initio vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiosum fuit, &amp;c.</hi>) And it is not meet, as no less Man than an <hi>Emperor</hi> hath determin'd, That the Authority of <hi>Custom</hi> should prevail so far, <hi>Ʋt aut Rationem vincat, aut Legem,</hi> as to overthrow Reason or Law. Which if it be good as you hold (and none can justly deny) against the Bishop of <hi>Rome's Jurisdiction</hi> over <hi>England;</hi> is it no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to be regarded in the <hi>Case</hi> between you and me? Wherein you claim to be paid <hi>without doing your Duty,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause you have been paid. May not he <hi>Pope it</hi> over this or other Nations which belong not to his <hi>Diocess,</hi> tho' for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly his <hi>Custom</hi> was to do it, because he ought not to</p>

            <p>Is it so, Sir, as you say? It doth not at all trouble me. I would rather rejoyce to see your <hi>Right and Power</hi> of this kind inlarged, provided it were well used. But why is that measure which you have, be it more or less, suffer'd to lye idle? wrapt up like a <hi>Talent in a Napkin?</hi> kept so close and out of sight, that no body can tell where to find the blessed fruits and effects of it?</p>
            <p>If you are not able to <hi>take away Iniquity, why would you seek to be a Judge?</hi> contrary to the Counsel which a wise man in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed hath given you, <hi>Eccles.</hi> 7.6.</p>
            <p>If you can, wherefore do you not? especially where you need not <hi>fear the person of the mighty?</hi> Ibid.</p>
            <p>If you know not what <hi>Crimes and Offences</hi> (in this part of your <hi>Archdeaconry,</hi> which you think it beneath you to <hi>visit,</hi> or will not take the trouble of <hi>visiting</hi>) need to be <hi>pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish'd, corrected, and reform'd,</hi> whom can you blame but your self, for being so great <hi>a stranger at home?</hi> If you know them, whence is it, that so much Prophaneness and Ungod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness, as is here to be met with, never meets with your <hi>Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastical Censures,</hi> but escapes your <hi>Rod of Discipline</hi> from Year to Year? For you greatly mistake, if you think, that others observe not how Scot-free it goes, what ever you your self do. If you say, there are no <hi>Presentments</hi> made of such Crimes and Offences, as I write of, whose fault is it that they have not been <hi>questioned,</hi> by whom Presentments have been wilfully omitted? The <hi>Question</hi> is, if it needs to be question'd, Whether you your self, knowing what <hi>Crimes</hi> deserve to be censur'd, are at all to be commended for letting them pass unpunished for so many Years together, as hitherto you have done?</p>
            <p>For if you should be interrogated upon the <hi>Articles of Inquiry</hi> exhibited to Church-wardens, what would you say to the 2d Article of your 4th Title, concerning <hi>Parishioners,</hi> (exchanging the word <hi>Parish,</hi> for <hi>Archdeaconry?</hi>)</p>
            <p>Were you asked, according to the <hi>Questions</hi> there put, (which are grounded on <hi>Can.</hi> 109. as you set it in the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin, in <hi>A. D.</hi> 1682.) <hi>Is there any person in your Archdeaconry, that lyeth under the common fame or vehement suspicion of Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery, Fornication or Incest?</hi> [What! Never a Man that hath married his Brother's Wife? Never a Woman that
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:37307:4"/> hath married two Brothers? Never a Man that hath put away his Wife to live in Whoredom?] <hi>Are there any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Drunkards within your Archdeaconry? or common Swear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers or Blasphemers of God's Name? or any that are noted to be Railers, unclean and filthy Talkers, or Sowers of Sedition, Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and Discord among their Neighbors?</hi> [Not as much as one Drunkard, Blasphemer, Swearer or lewd Liver in all this part of your Archdeaconry? <hi>Quam vellem!</hi>]</p>
            <p>Would you say, that you know none such; never heard of any such; or believe that no such sinners are here to be found? I am far from thinking you would give such an <hi>Answer.</hi> Supposing therefore, that you <hi>know, have heard or believe, that there are such within these your Precincts,</hi> why should you, being a Man of <hi>Jurisdiction,</hi> have suffered your Power to lye dormant these many Years, without <hi>punishing and correcting</hi> any one of these sinners, in order to his Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation?</p>
            <p>Let the rest of your Archdeaconry be as free as it will, (tho' I scarce believe it to be morally better than this stormy, dirty, rainy, windy part of it is;) you need not here com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain for want of work of that kind, would you please to come and try what good you can do, that you may not fall under the Censure and Reprehension of <hi>Rodoric Bishop of Za<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mora,</hi> (in his Book, <hi>de Vita Spirituali,</hi> dedicated to Pope <hi>Paul</hi> the Second, <hi>cap.</hi> 14. <hi>de Dignitate &amp; Praerogativa necnon de Defectibus &amp; periculis Archidiac.</hi>) who alluding to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon speech or phrase which calls an <hi>Archdeacon</hi> the <hi>Bishop's Eye,</hi> saith, The Bishop is often compelled to say, <hi>Contenebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti sunt Oculi mei,</hi> That his Eyes are darkned; <hi>&amp; iterum cum alio Propheta: Nihil respiciunt Oculi mei nisi mala. Quibus a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius Propheta ait, Dedit tibi Dominus deficientes Oculos—</hi> And again with another <hi>Prophet,</hi> That his Eyes behold nothing but what is evil: [not to <hi>correct</hi> and <hi>reform,</hi> but <hi>pass it by:</hi>] with a great many other <hi>applications</hi> of Scripture-passages to the purpose before spoken of.</p>
            <p>If you please to examine and reform the <hi>Defects</hi> which the said <hi>Author</hi> chargeth Men of your Office with, take heed of overlooking these, among others: <hi>Propter obsequia delicta non reprimunt: Arcas non Personas visitant: nec ad lucrum Anima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum, sed ad questum &amp; gravamen</hi> Visitandi Officium <hi>vertunt.

And if you desire to <hi>break the Pillars of</hi> Rome <hi>all to pieces,</hi> be as strict in requiring as great and high <hi>Conformity to the Laws of God, as the Churches Ceremonies and Constitutions,</hi> lest otherwise you build them up faster with <hi>one</hi> hand than you break them down with the <hi>other.</hi> For the <hi>Church of Rome,</hi> you know, is as much <hi>too loose</hi> in things per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining to God, as <hi>too strict</hi> in observing the Commandments of Men (which they <hi>teach for Doctrins;</hi>) no less <hi>curious</hi> than the Pharisees of old about small concerns, and as <hi>careless</hi> as they in omitting the <hi>weightier matters of the Law.</hi>

Should not you, being <hi>a Man of Jurisdiction,</hi> have done more than you have to prevent it? Let me therefore ask you again, <hi>If you cannot put away Iniquity, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:37307:5"/> you sought to be a Judge?</hi> And how can you tell what you can or cannot do, without tryal? Who, in these parts, ever heard you <hi>preach the Word?</hi> Who ever found you <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant</hi> (or urgent) <hi>in season or out of season?</hi> [Either when worldly Wisdom and human Policy have judg'd it <hi>unsea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable,</hi> or at other times? when danger hath attended the discharge of your Office, or when no fear hath been at hand to discourage you?] Whether of the two have you done? And according to the following part of the Charge, <hi>[Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove, rebuke, exhort, with all long-suffering and doctrin]</hi> have you tryed the force of those excellent <hi>Apostolical Remedies</hi> (Reprehension, Increpation and Persuasion, sweetned with Lenity and Instruction?)</p>
            <p>When the <hi>Spirit of Love and Meekness</hi> could do them no good, have you taken your <hi>Rod</hi> in hand to <hi>punish, correct and reform the Crimes and Offences</hi> of notorious sinners?</p>
            <p>I have reason to think you have rather dreamt of <hi>a Lyon in the way,</hi> than done it. [If not, tell me when and where and what faults were ever chastised with it. Is it no fault for a Man to marry his <hi>Brother's</hi> Wife? St. <hi>John the Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tist</hi> told <hi>Herod,</hi> it was not lawful for him to have <hi>his Brother</hi> Philip<hi>'s Wife,</hi> tho' <hi>Philip,</hi> if <hi>Josephus</hi> may be credited, was at that time dead. Is it no crime <hi>for a Man to put away his Wife,</hi> who was never so much as suspected to have deserved it, (by the <hi>fault</hi> which Christ only allows her to be <hi>put away for</hi>) and live like <hi>Sardanapalus,</hi> or worse, with stranger Women than his? Is it no offence for a Man to forsake his Church (and all publick <hi>Assemblies</hi> where God is worshipt) for near twenty Years together, and yet pretend to be of the Church of <hi>England?</hi>] And altho' I believe not that <hi>any such Rod</hi> as that which is spoken of in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. <hi>ult.</hi> can be found in your keeping; (you cannot smite an <hi>Elymas</hi> with blindness, nor cause an <hi>Ananias</hi> or <hi>Saphira,</hi> much less both, to yield up the ghost;) yet such as you have, why will you suffer to <hi>rot and be worm-eaten</hi> for want of use, unless you fear of wearing it out with too much using? Is it only fit for little and not greater occasions? intended for none but <hi>feeble transgressors,</hi> and not the strongest sort of sinners, who dare strike again? If you were not a stranger to the nature or exercise of <hi>Zeal,</hi> you would not chase <hi>Harts</hi> and <hi>Hares</hi> and

            <p>The learned, for ought I know, have not yet determin'd whether Excommunication and <hi>Delivering up to Satan,</hi> (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.5.) are the same, or different things: If you take them for the same, and observe the force and elegance of the word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, which signifies, you know, to deliver up; what implies it, but <hi>that the Devil demands and requires scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous sinners to be yielded up to him as his right and property?</hi> If that, as no vulgar <hi>Expositor</hi> will tell you, is imply'd in the sense of the term, the common same of this Country hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready condemn'd you, <hi>for not having given the Devil his due:</hi> who, as bad as he is, must not be wronged or defrauded how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, unless your <hi>Archidiaconal power</hi> is great enough to prove the <hi>Proverb</hi> a lyar.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Archdeacons</hi> in old time were as great rarities as <hi>Lay-Elders;</hi> but if <hi>Zeal</hi> had been as rare in <hi>those</hi> days as in <hi>these,</hi> St. <hi>Laurence</hi> his <hi>Grid-iron</hi> had never been heard of; (let those who say he was <hi>Archdeacon</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> prove it if they can; I am confident there is reason to believe, that he never was. The Office is younger than those days;) the <hi>Book of Martyrs</hi> had been but a <hi>Manual;</hi> the <hi>noble Army</hi> (whose memory is honor'd in the <hi>Te Deum</hi>) had never been heard of; and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead of another such <hi>cloud of Witnesses</hi> as that, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 12.1. we had never seen a bigger than that little one <hi>like a man's hand,</hi> which we read of in 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 18.44. And if other <hi>Archdeacons</hi> have done no more than you <hi>to correct and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form Crimes and Offences,</hi> which (to render them the more odious) have been impudently committed, obstinately con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued in, <hi>and loudly talked of;</hi> it is not strange, that <hi>Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity should abound as it doth,</hi> nor at all to be admir'd, that <hi>the love of many</hi> (to all that is good) <hi>is grown so cold.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Did you never read or hear of a <hi>French</hi> King (another manner of <hi>Lewis</hi> than the 14th of that name) whose <hi>Motto,</hi> which he borrowed from <hi>Psal.</hi> 106.3. was, <hi>Beati qui fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciunt Justitiam; Blessed are they that do Justice?</hi> He was wont moreover, to say, <hi>De noxiis supplicium non sumere saevitiae magis quam Misericordiae nomen meretur</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">Asted. Tom. <hi>4.</hi> p. <hi>104.</hi>
               </note>; <hi>That it is not Mercy but Cruelty not to punish the guilty.</hi> Is it fit or tolerable, that your delight in doing Justice should be less than his? or that any
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:37307:6"/> of the guilty within your Jurisdiction should be handled so cruelly and unmercifully, as by reason of your negligence they have been? Your earnest affectation of a Justice-ship is no News: but to be a Justice, so called, is one thing, to do Justice, another. And what, in good earnest, is it which keeps you from exercising and exerting the right and power of punishing, correcting and reforming Crimes and Offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, which you make so great a Boast of in your Libel? If the want of Zeal and Courage in the Cause of God and his Church hath hitherto hindred you, it is high time for a Man of your Place and Calling to consider, how <hi>good</hi> it is <hi>to be zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lously affected alway,</hi> (no less when danger goes with it than at other times: Then indeed it is best; most commendable and needful;) as that eminently zealous Apostle should long since, one would think, have taught you to be, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.18. From whence, if I should tell you, that the zealous affection which he there commends, is <hi>[Bonum honestum, jucundum, utile; Bonum per se &amp; per accidens; Bonum communicativum sui &amp; conservativum aliorum; Bonum perpetuum &amp; necessarium,]</hi> so constant, permanent and needful a Good as is never out of season, like divers other good things; briefly, so very good, that little or nothing in Religion is good without it, (Charity being but cold Love, Faith but faint Persuasion, Hope but groundless Presumption, while Zeal is wanting;) I know not how great News it would seem, but is never the less true (like many other things) for being strange. If it were not more than half as good as it is, it would be but a bad bargain to exchange it for the greatest Jurisdiction in Christendom without it. Being such as it is, (and should here, but for want of room, be farther shewed to be) who that is destitute of it, can be a vigilant Visitor, and not a negligent Over-looker? a compleat Christian, and not a lukewarm <hi>Laodicean?</hi> a good Soldier of Jesus Christ, and not a timorous <hi>Tyro,</hi> or fearful Coward, whose condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is as dangerous as that of an Unbeliever? <hi>Rev.</hi> 21.8. Or what good can all your other goods do you, while this is wanting? If you think your self rich and increased with it, (like those self-deceivers, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.17.) know, that Zeal is a Talent which cannot be wrapt in a Napkin, and laid up out of sight: a Grace which can no more be hid than Fire,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:37307:7"/> which discovers where it is by light and heat. But who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever saw the light or felt the fervency of your zealous affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction? when did it shine clear enough to be seen? or burn well enough to be felt? How much <hi>old Leaven</hi> hath this good affection helped you to <hi>purge out?</hi> What <hi>root of bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terness</hi> hath it hindred from springing up? or nipt in the bud as soon as it appeared? How unable <hi>to bear with them that are evil,</hi> hath it rendred you?</p>
            <p>These are Questions worth the answering; but I know not what Answer worth the hearing you are able to give, who, as if your Jurisdiction were good for nothing but to be gloried in, (without putting it to better use) are so far from reforming Abuses, (too palpable to be dissembled, too shameful to be winked at,) that you will not condes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend to come and see what's amiss. For you vainly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume that you are not obliged to do it, as by proof suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient hath been shewed. I must therefore renew the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion (once already asked, but as yet unanswered,) what hinders that the right and power of punishing, correcting and reforming, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> so pompously set forth in your Libel, hath been so rarely, if at all put forth in your practice? Especially when more than ordinary Crimes have called up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on you so loudly, to make it better known than by libel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the innocent, while the peccant are let alone? <hi>Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom that is hid,</hi> and <hi>Treasure that is hoarded up, what pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit is in them both? Ecclus.</hi> 20.30. Is a Candle lighted to be put under a Bushel or Bed? <hi>Mark</hi> 4.21. To be co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered with a Vessel? <hi>Luke</hi> 18.16. Or kept in a secret place? <hi>Luke</hi> 11.33. And not to be set on a Candlestick to give light round about? Was the slothful Servant's Talent delivered to be hid in the Earth? <hi>Matt.</hi> 25.25. Or his Pound to be laid up in a Napkin (<hi>Luke</hi> 19.20.) and not traded with for his Master's advantage?</p>
            <p>Be it more or less, a Talent or Pound of Jurisdiction which these many years hath been committed to your Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stody, why have you suffer'd it to ly idle, as if you had no Lord to call you to a reckoning, like those other Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants? <hi>Matt.</hi> 25.19.</p>
            <p>You are loth, I believe, to speak out; and I doubt not but that as <hi>Moses,</hi> when God would have sent him into
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:37307:7"/>
               <hi>Egypt,</hi> made many excuses to prevent his going thither, not naming the true Cause of his backwardness, which seems, by comparing <hi>Exod.</hi> 3.15. with <hi>Exod.</hi> 4.19. to have been his fear of suffering death for killing an <hi>Egyptian</hi> forty years before; (<hi>Acts</hi> 7.30.) for which cause it is probable, God was pleased to answer that great but tacit Objection which <hi>Moses</hi> was afraid to mention, by saying Go, return to <hi>Egypt;</hi> for all the Men are dead which sought thy life. Now as he pleaded other Impediments by way of excuse than that which indeed hindred him; so I doubt not, I say, but that you will name other grounds of your negligence, while the true Cause is conceal'd: Shall I there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore take the Candle which you keep in a dark Lanthorn, and set it on a Candlestick? Whether it will please or dislike you, time and place I am sure call upon me to tell you the Truth, take it how you list.</p>
            <p>Among those who adhere to the Church of <hi>England</hi> there are (if not as many as some talk of, and are willing to believe; yet too many such there are) whose whole Religion consisteth in a cheap and easy Conformity to a sort of Rites and Ceremonies, which are clearly more worthy to be called <hi>Statutes that are not good</hi> (intrinsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally,) and <hi>Judgments whereby</hi> (without more ado be they never so strictly observ'd) <hi>we shall not live,</hi> than those which God himself, and not <hi>Moses,</hi> or any man else was Author of, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 20.25. [being openly confessed in the late Preface to the Liturgy, to be <hi>things in their own Nature indifferent and alterable, and so acknowledg'd;</hi> as also in an elder Chapter of Ceremonies, <hi>why some are abolish'd and some retain'd;</hi> they are declared to be but <hi>Man's Ordinances, which upon just Causes may be alter'd and changed,</hi> and therefore are not to be esteemed <hi>equal to God's Law:</hi>] as if this would excuse their <hi>Non-conformity</hi> to as great and weighty moral Duties, as clear and express Evangelical Precepts and Divine Mandates as any in the Bible.</p>
            <p>These are the People who cry up the Church of <hi>England,</hi> with as much or little less Ignorance and Irreligion, than the Jews of old were guilty of; when <hi>the Temple of the Lord</hi> was as much in their Mouths, and <hi>the Lord of the</hi>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:37307:8"/> Temple as little in their Hearts, as his greatest Enemy could desire, <hi>Jer.</hi> 7.4, 9, 10.</p>
            <p>By these the Government of this most happy Church, that would be, but that they as much as any have hindred it, is extold to the Skies, though I verily believe that none would hate and despise it more than they, should they feel the weight of those heavy <hi>Church-Censures,</hi> which far less Sinners are many times <hi>forced</hi> to undergo.</p>
            <p>Your fear of offending and displeasing these <hi>dissolute Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple</hi> is that, I make no doubt, which hath kept you from taking up your <hi>Rod</hi> (such as 'tis) to chastise the <hi>Crimes and Offences,</hi> which you boast of having <hi>Right and Power to punish, correct and reform.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Some feeble <hi>Dissenters</hi> who could not resist you, I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, to have heard how <hi>severely</hi> you have handled: But how much <hi>Ʋngodliness,</hi> how many <hi>worldly Lusts,</hi> (which are cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly as inconsistent with <hi>the Grace of God that bringeth Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,</hi> as Schism; especially such as springs from <hi>Weakness,</hi> and is not an effect of <hi>Wilfulness,</hi>) have you taught the People of your Archdeaconry to <hi>deny,</hi> or bestir'd your self to <hi>subdue?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For the Question is not how <hi>successful,</hi> but how <hi>painful</hi> you have been to bring such mighty things to pass? What have you done to heal the <hi>sin-sick,</hi> (as well as the <hi>brain-sick</hi>) tho' they <hi>would not be healed?</hi> Jer. 51.9. How much pain have you taken, tho' to no purpose? How much have you <hi>labor'd in vain?</hi> How much <hi>Strength</hi> have you spent <hi>for nought and in vain?</hi> That at least (and especially at last) you may comfort your self with saying, <hi>Surely my Judgment is with the Lord, and my Reward with my God,</hi> Esa. 49.4.</p>
            <p>How much <hi>Rioting and Drunkenness, Chambering and Wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonness,</hi> cursing, swearing, or any other sort of prophaneness have you, if not <hi>actually</hi> suppressed, yet <hi>actively</hi> opposed and resisted; lest the wicked, as otherwise they will, should grow <hi>worse and worse,</hi> and not better and better? If you could not <hi>cure</hi> them, have you <hi>taken care</hi> at least to help and heal them, according to St. <hi>Bernard</hi>'s distinction of <hi>cura</hi> and <hi>curatio?</hi> Who discoursing like a wise Physitian, with <hi>Eugenius</hi> Bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi> about the Diseases of his People,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:37307:8"/> stir'd him up to ply them with the more Remedies, and to try the stronger Medicines, the more sick and distemper'd they were: In these, among many other words. <hi>En plaga!

            <p>What have you done like this? How many sick People (there are multitudes, I am sure, within the verge of your Jurisdiction, who are far more Soul-sick than that good Man (<hi>Psal.</hi> 41.4.) who knew his Disease, tho' these do not; how many of these) have you tried to heal? How many <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers</hi> (here also there are worse than those whom the Priest was formerly Judge of, <hi>Levit.</hi> 13.) have you <hi>taken care</hi> to cleanse? How many <hi>dead</hi> (in trespasses and sins) have you labor'd to <hi>raise?</hi> How many Devils and <hi>unclean Spirits</hi> (such as Fornicators, Adulterers and other Sinners are possest with) have you done your best to <hi>cast out?</hi> How close have you kept to the Tenor of that old, but not antiquated <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription,</hi>

            <p>For the same <hi>Cures</hi> are now to be wrought which then were: or, if any difference there be, greater and harder. <hi>Spiritual sickness,</hi> we see by experience, is harder to be heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed than <hi>Corporal;</hi> Spiritual <hi>Leprosie</hi> more difficult to be cleansed than Natural: and the <hi>sinful Devil</hi> was sooner dispossest in those days than <hi>the Devil of sin can now be cast out.</hi>

What sort of Sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, what manner of Diseases have you <hi>cur'd</hi> or undertaken the <hi>cure of?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Never tell me, <hi>They will not be healed;</hi> They shall answer for that themselves, if they will not. But unless you go bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter about to heal them, than thus far you have done, <hi>look you to that.</hi>

            <p>When did your courage ever serve you to enter the Lists with any of these, or the like? And, a little to reflect on <hi>Bernard</hi>'s Advice to <hi>Eugenius,</hi> how many Dragons and Scor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pions have you dared to meddle with?</p>
            <p>Here I might tell you of an old Dragon, a red Dragon, a fiery flying Dragon, and a dry thirsty Dragon, which you ought to have <hi>waged War</hi> with no less than <hi>Michael and his Angels</hi> with that horrible <hi>Apocalyptical Dragon,</hi> (Rev. 12.7.—) but that I suspect you long to be deliver'd of a Jest; (tho' your <hi>hard labor</hi> heretofore undergon, especially with such ill success, should discourage you, methinks, from ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turing again. When ever you do, take heed of <hi>Scripture-Jests,</hi> I beseech you: such as <hi>Pharaoh-Ale,</hi> and the like. For I little doubt but that the Devil himself hath as much to do in making and breaking such Jests, as his Instruments them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves. But this <hi>obiter.</hi> To return:) You will tell me per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, that you are not of the Race of St. <hi>George,</hi> (who, they say, was a <hi>Cappadocian</hi>) to fight with Dragons. Say you so? let me then tell you (tho' I formerly thought an <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishman</hi> as stout as any man) too serious a thing to be jested with; which is, That you do but delude your self with a dream of <hi>pleasing God,</hi> while your sordid fear of <hi>displeasing Men</hi> is so great and predominant, that I rather <hi>wish than hope</hi> to see you cast it off. To this I ascribe it, that your Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent of <hi>punishing, correcting and reforming,</hi> &amp;c. hath so long been <hi>hid in the earth,</hi> till of late you took it up, (what to do?) not to use, but abuse it, by boasting; not to shew, that it is not lost, wasted, or squander'd away, but <hi>to stuff out a sorry Libel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And is this the best use which you purpose hereafter to put it to? If it be, the Church of <hi>England</hi> will have little reason to con you thanks for keeping it so long in your hands to no better purpose. Should she never call you to account take heed lest a greater than she come to reckon with you, for receiving such <hi>Right and Power</hi> as you talk of in vain.</p>
            <p>But wherefore, I pray, should the fear of displeasing those loose livers (for whose reformation your <hi>Power</hi> was given you) so deter you from using it, that both they and you are
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:37307:10"/> the worse for not putting it forth? They, by being har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den'd in their sins, for want of restraint; You, in becoming a partaker of their guiltiness, by neglecting to restrain them. What is't you fear? The loss of their Company? Their desertion of a Churches communion which will not allow them a liberty of sinning? If that makes you timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, you know who hath told you (and prov'd it too, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the danger of a refutation, in his <hi>Preface to a Special Account of Wrongs,</hi> &amp;c.) that the greatest number imagin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able of such vile people as are now spoken of, will do us more hurt than good: That the beauty, strength and safety of a Church consisteth not in a <hi>bare multitude,</hi> but in an <hi>ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved multitude</hi> only: That not by the <hi>number,</hi> but <hi>goodness</hi> of its Members, the well-being of a Church must be mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sur'd: And that no protection to a Church or Nation can be derived from any such multitude, hath been there like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likewise shewed, by as sure and sad Examples as ever were heard of. We are not the safer for being <hi>many,</hi> but the more in danger for being <hi>ungodly.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The learned and judicious Author of a Treatise, called the <hi>Protestant Reconciler,</hi> (for writing and publishing which he merited a better Reward than I hear he met with) having deliver'd a Proposition which seems to favour your negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, but indeed doth not; that you may not take hold of it to your hurt, I will now, before I go farther, look as far into it (without any design of contradicting so worthy an Author) as is requisite to leave you without excuse, from thence at least fetched.</p>
            <p>The sum of the Proposition (laid down in <hi>Part</hi> II. <hi>p.</hi> 255. of the <hi>Protest. Reconc.</hi>) is this:</p>
            <p>
               <q>That as much the duty of Church-Officers as <hi>Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication</hi> must be granted to be, it is not however a Duty necessary to be exercised <hi>at all Times,</hi> on <hi>all Offenders,</hi> in <hi>all Conjunctures,</hi> but only then when 'tis like to do more good than hurt. For all agree, that affirmative Duties do not bind <hi>ad semper—</hi> Now the harm our Church might suffer by the strict exercise of these her Censures, in this Age of general loosness, upon <hi>all</hi> Offenders, even those of
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:37307:10"/> the highest rank and quality among us, is threefold.</q>
            </p>
            <p n="1">
               <q>1. That hereby they may be exasperated against the Government and Office which inflicts these Censures, and be induced to use their Power to undermine and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw it, and to set up her Enemies upon the ruins of it.</q>
            </p>
            <p n="2">
               <q>2. They may some of them be tempted to fly off from her Government, to one of the two potent Factions now among us, and so may strengthen them and weaken us. Or,</q>
            </p>
            <p n="3">
               <q>3. That being sceptically and atheistically inclin'd, they would but rally on the Execution of these Censures, and we, by executing them, should only <hi>rebuke the Scorner,</hi> which the wise Man forbids.</q> If you list to see more of this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, (as doubtless you'l be glad to find any thing which is but seemingly favourable to you; and this is no more;) consult the Author himself. But I see not how this, or any thing that follows, can help you.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Because altho' the Reverend Author begins the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position pointed at (which is his 7th) with the grand Case of <hi>Excommunication,</hi> yet you'l find, that in his 9th Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition (<hi>pag.</hi> 260.) he is far from asserting, That all those whose presence with us in our Church-Assemblies doth so much offend Dissenters, deserve immediately to be secluded from Communion with us, before they have been both pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately and publickly <hi>admonished by the Church.</hi> For how can they be said (as he gives his reason so far in favor of them) <hi>not to hear the Church,</hi> when they have not been admonish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by her to reform, or threatned with her Censures if they will not?</p>
            <p>How many of these Sinners have you admonished pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly, privately, sharply, or mildly, at any time, or in any manner? I could never yet hear of any such <hi>unruly trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressors</hi> and <hi>disorderly walkers,</hi> as are spoken of in 1 <hi>Thess.</hi> 5.14. 2 <hi>Thess.</hi> 3.6. whom you took the pain to warn. I know too well whom you have not warned, and am sure, by what you lately told me, that you are not to seek. Your <hi>excuse,</hi> why you did it not, was <hi>so weak,</hi> that for certain I shall do you a kindness (who never did me any, but the contrary) to conceal it.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="20" facs="tcp:37307:11"/>2. Supposing, but not<note n="*" place="margin">For St. <hi>Austin</hi>'s Judgment is not generally subscribed to (especially for the Reasons which he grounds it on) tho' <hi>Grotius</hi> once seemed satisfied with it, <hi>That the Censures of the Church must be let alone, when the number of Offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders is great:</hi> (as the Author of a <hi>Special and Further Account of diverse Wrongs,</hi> &amp;c. (you know the Man, I presume) hath sufficiently, for his purpose, shewed, before ever he saw or heard of the <hi>Protestant Reconciler,</hi> to my knowledge, who have reason to know it as well as any Man living: And if sinners of <hi>high rank</hi> and <hi>quality</hi> must alway go uncensur'd, when will the World be reform'd? or, if that is too much to hope for, the Church? Had St. <hi>Ambrose</hi> been of his opinion, so great and mighty, so prosperous and victorious an Emperor as <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dosius</hi> had never been forbidden to enter the Church at <hi>Millan,</hi> nor de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed the liberty of communicating with the Faithful there assembled, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til his guiltiness was purged by pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, and the truth of his sorrow testified by such visible signs and to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens, as make it questionable, whether of the two (his Sin or Repentance) was greatest. <hi>Vid.

You need not question their being <hi>exasperated a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst your Jurisdiction,</hi> or induc'd to use their power to <hi>undermine and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw it,</hi> that enemies may be set up on the ruines of it; They are neither so many nor mighty. And why should you trouble your self with a vain fear of tempting them to fly off from the Government of a Church, which they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not depart from, but by <hi>running out of smoak into fire?</hi> For where will they find easier terms and conditions of commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion than here? If they purpose to live and die Members of any Church at all, what can be desir'd which is not here to be met with, besides the <hi>due dispensation of Discipline,</hi> which is not the thing they seek? If it is, you wrong them in withholding it. If they mind to go farther for it, they will find themselves deceived in undergoing more <hi>arbitrary and unequal Censures</hi> than are here to be feared, when matters are
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:37307:11"/> fairly carried, and not left to the conduct of such as they belong not to: which, if you and others, more ambitious <hi>of having than using Jurisdiction aright,</hi> well minded your bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness, would never be done. And what if some, that are <hi>sceptically and atheistically inclin'd, should rally on the Execution of Censures</hi> which their sins have made them justly subject to? They would not, I hope, make an <hi>Army</hi> as big and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midable as that which lately besieged <hi>Vienna.</hi> It is more than I know whether more than one to a hundred of better people can be found within your limits. Therefore still I must ask you, what is it which you fear? Lest nothing but <hi>a scorner's hatred by reproving him,</hi> (contrary to the wise King's counsel, <hi>Prov.</hi> 9.8.) should be gained? You are certainly besides the Text, if you take it to be spoken of more than <hi>private increpation.</hi> For I cannot understand what reason you have or can have to think, that St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Rule, (<hi>Them that sin rebuke before all, that others also may fear,</hi> 1 Tim. 5.20.) is contrary to King <hi>Solomon</hi>'s: And I know not where to find sinners (as great plenty of them as there is) more firmly seated in the <hi>chair of scorners,</hi> than those whom Christ and his Proto-Martyr rebuked with words <hi>as sharp</hi> as swords, <hi>Matth.</hi> 23.33. <hi>Acts</hi> 7.51.</p>
            <p>Thence I must tell you again, (and it will not perhaps be the last time) that you vainly tell me in your Libel, of your being a Man of Jurisdiction, having <hi>right and power to correct,</hi> &amp;c. If you have, Sir, it is not like Faith in some cases, (<hi>Rom.</hi> 14.22.) <hi>to be had to your self.</hi> Publick power must be publickly shewed, that the Publick may be the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for it. Otherwise it is nothing worth. And what good Magistrate, think you, forbears to rebuke <hi>sinners</hi> because they are <hi>scorners?</hi> or for fear of their hatred?</p>
            <p>If you say, that you must <hi>not give that which is holy to dogs, nor cast your pearls</hi> (of reprehension) <hi>before swine, lest they trample them under their feet, and turn again and rent you,</hi> (Mat. 7.6.) How can you tell, that the sinners now spoken of, are <hi>dogs and swine?</hi> Did they ever <hi>bite</hi> you for offering them any of those <hi>holy things</hi> which they rather desired you should keep to your self? or as much as <hi>bark</hi> at your reproofs, like those whom the <hi>Philippians</hi> were warned to <hi>beware</hi> of? <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.2. And when were your <hi>Pearls trampled under the feet of
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:37307:12"/> these swine</hi> (if you'l take them to be such on trust, before you have tryed what manner of creatures they are) to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scourage you from casting any more before them? How much of your <hi>Counsel hath been despised?</hi> How many of your <hi>Reproofs set at nought?</hi> Prov. 1.25. What pain have you ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to no purpose, that you think it but lost labor, to be far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther concern'd about them?</p>
            <p>To such as are desperately sick, to what end should Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sic be given? But who taught you to conclude, the <hi>Condition</hi> of these People to be irrecoverable, their <hi>Cure</hi> impossible, and their <hi>Case</hi> desperate, without <hi>trying</hi> whether any good could be done them or not?</p>
            <p>You are probably more taken than is fit with those pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages of St. <hi>Austin,</hi> (if you are not a stranger to them, as I was not before I saw them in the <hi>Protestant Reconciler</hi>) in in which he asserts, That a Censure inflicted <hi>of, or by many</hi> (having respect, I suppose to 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.6.) cannot be <hi>salutary</hi> or healing, unless the sinner who undergoes it is destitute of <hi>many</hi> partners (or brethren in iniquity.) But when the <hi>most</hi> are sick of the same disease, those <hi>few</hi> good people who are whole (having no need of a Physician) can betake them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to no other Remedy <hi>than Sighs and Sorrow,</hi> (if that will do them any good.) And indeed, as he goes on, <hi>The conta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion of sin having spread it self among a multitude of people, the severe pity of divine discipline is needful</hi> (to reform and heal them) <hi>but to separate from them is vain and pernicious, impious, and sacrilegious; being that which will more disturb the good who are weak, than amend the bad who are head-strong.</hi> Vid. Aug. con. Parmen. Epist. lib. 3.</p>
            <p>Which to me seems little better than lying still in a Ditch and crying <hi>God help!</hi> For when are Physicians busiest in applying Remedies, but when they have <hi>most Patients</hi> who need them? And if Chirurgions will be idle in a Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spital of maim'd and wounded Soldiers, where will they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stir themselves?</p>
            <p>But suppose St. <hi>Austin</hi>'s Doctrin in the Case before us to be Orthodox: Here is no such <hi>Socia multitudo,</hi> or compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of Consorts, as he speaks of, to hinder proceedings; no such <hi>contagio peccandi, multitudinem invadens,</hi> or spreading Contagion, as he points at, to render your Discipline useless,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:37307:12"/> (as before was noted) the scandalous in comparison of the rest being few; and they too, no more to be feared for their <hi>power</hi> than <hi>number.</hi> Wherefore then will you leave them to the <hi>severe mercy of Divine discipline,</hi> as if you expected to have them reformed, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> was converted, <hi>by a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle,</hi> but to save your self labour, and because you are clearly overcome and overgrown with a sordid sort of fear, which becomes not a <hi>Church-warden,</hi> much less an <hi>Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deacon?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>You have seen a little Dog, which might neerly be put in a Glove, scare a whole flock of Sheep, who running them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves almost out of breath before they stop, at last turn a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, gazing and wondring what <hi>Monster</hi> it should be.</p>
            <p>It is possible, that a single sinner here or there may scare a whole flock of <hi>Church-wardens:</hi> But who can think it tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, that an <hi>Archdeacon</hi> should be as timorous? Should one or other make you run from your Duty as fast as the Sheep run away from their Pasture, when many of them to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether can do you no more hurt than the <hi>Curr</hi> did the Sheep? You may think it enough to reform your self, let what will become of those who <hi>will not be reform'd,</hi> (Lev. 26.23.) but <hi>hate it.</hi> (Psal. 50.17.)</p>
            <p>Is it so? This will scarce serve a private Christian's turn, unless <hi>Leviticus</hi> 19.17. hath been commonly misapplied. If that will not do, <hi>Rom.</hi> 15.14. <hi>Ephes.</hi> 5.11. <hi>Coloss.</hi> 3.16. <hi>Heb.</hi> 3.13. <hi>Hebr.</hi> 10.24, 25. will abundantly prove, that <hi>Exhortation, Admonition,</hi> and <hi>Reprehension,</hi> are common Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties which Christians must mutually discharge for each others benefit, as well in private as publick Stations, the Apostle putting no distinction or exception to favor the <hi>cowardly fear</hi> of any that desire to be exempted from medling with that (mostly) ungrateful Office. None but <hi>Cain, who was of that wicked one,</hi> (1 <hi>John</hi> 3.12.) whom our Savior calls a <hi>Lyer and a Murtherer from the beginning, (John</hi> 8.44.) would have dared to ask the Almighty such an odd question as that, (<hi>Gen.</hi> 4.9.) <hi>Am I my Brother's keeper?</hi> The Law of Nature, (which requires, that the stronger should defend the weaker, and the elder take care of the younger,) made him <hi>Guardian</hi> to his Brother. They are not therefore governed by the <hi>good Spirit of God,</hi> but possessed with that <hi>evil Spirit</hi>
               <pb n="24" facs="tcp:37307:13"/> which moved that Proto-Murtherer to kill his Brother, who little regard what becomes of others, while they themselves, as they hope (but in vain in such a case) are safe. If an <hi>Enemies Ox or Ass,</hi> going astray, must be reduced or brought back to the Owner, or being otherwise in danger, must be helped, (<hi>Exod.</hi> 23.4, 5.) how much more <hi>a Friend's or Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's?</hi> much more his own <hi>Body,</hi> much more his <hi>Soul, which is more worth than a World,</hi> as he who best knows the worth of Souls, by the Price which he paid for their Redemption, hath told us, <hi>Matth.</hi> 16.26. What but this gave <hi>Rabanus</hi> an occasion of observing, (on <hi>Matth.</hi> 18.) <hi>that it is not a less offence not to tell an offending brother of a fault, than not to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give him when he asketh forgiveness.</hi> For he that saith, <hi>If thy brother trespass against thee and repent, forgive him,</hi> says like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, If he trespass, <hi>rebuke him, (Luke</hi> 17.4.) or accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Saint <hi>Matthew, (chap.</hi> 18.15.) <hi>Go and tell him of his fault.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So it will not serve a private Christian's turn, to look to himself only. But for a Man of Jurisdiction, who <hi>magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies his Office</hi> at such a rate as you do in your Libel, (that a stranger to the story of Archdeacons would begin to su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect their Office to be, if not a <hi>Jure-divino-Dignity,</hi> yet at least an <hi>Apostolical Institution;</hi> whereas in truth their thoughts never soared higher than Deacons, whom, without the concurrence or allowance of a Country-Justice, they or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained to be Over-seers of the Poor, <hi>Acts</hi> 6.1,—6. for such a Man I say) to be persuaded, that in point of reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, he needs not look <hi>beyond himself,</hi> is so monstrous and absurd, so intolerable and abominable an Opinion, that your <hi>quondam</hi> Judgment of Lay-Elders comes not near it for strangeness or wickedness. For those new Church-Officers that in some places were, in others would or should have been, could you have been heard, (the Churches you then thought must be <hi>elder'd</hi> before the Lord's Supper could be celebrated in due form and manner) might have passed well enough, for ought I know, if they had not been obtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded and imposed as a necessary, <hi>Scriptural</hi> and <hi>Apostolical</hi> sort of People; at which rate, if you or any other should extol <hi>Archdeacons,</hi> I would not less oppose the one than the other sort of <hi>Pretenders.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="25" facs="tcp:37307:13"/>
            <p>But this vain Persuasion, or execrable Presumption rather, (<hi>viz.</hi> That Self-reformation is sufficient for a Man of your <hi>Order</hi> and <hi>Power</hi>) is so pernicious, and to all good Manners so ruinous, that it needs a better Master of words than I am, to express it.</p>
            <p>If you say, that you are not of this mind, Wherefore is it, that you act and carry your self (or rather sit still and do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing) as if you thought so?

            <p>I know where to find you, Sir! You will tell me, that the faults which I speak of, were never presented by any of the <hi>Church-wardens</hi> in whose Parishes they have been and still are committed. But, I pray, talk no more of that; for I know that you know them, by what you lately told me, in excuse of your negligence; which indeed was so vain, that I should do you no small kindness (as hath once already been inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated) to conceal it: but you know what you deserve for your late prevarication (which must elsewhere be spoken of) which calls upon me to tell you, that what you told me (to excuse your negligence in the best manner you could) was so pitiful a <hi>shift,</hi> that a Child it self, to escape a whip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping, seldom makes use of a <hi>weaker.</hi> That you had not power to punish Offences which by a late <hi>Act of Grace</hi> were pardon'd, was your <hi>Plea,</hi> and a pretty one, was it not? What! had you no power in more than twenty years be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore? Hath any body taken it from you since, that the same sins repeated over and over, should escape as scot-free as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore? or what's the matter? Hereafter be advised to <hi>Rule with more diligence,</hi> (according to the <hi>Rule</hi> set before you, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.8.) that you may not need such sorry shifts and evasions. An <hi>excuseless inexcusable Excuse,</hi> if I should call it, all would be little enough to set forth the weakness of that which (the matter being capable of no better, that is, of none at all) you were not asham'd to use. And if any of your Under-Officers, (<hi>Church-wardens</hi> and <hi>Side-men</hi>) whom you press so hard to get sworn, (more for love of Mony than for any better end or greater good that comes

You that have helped us to the <hi>Laws of England</hi> in a Nut-shell, are you to seek that <hi>whoso concealeth Treason is a Traitor?</hi> Is not he then, by parity of reason, who winks at other Men's sins, a Sinner of the same Rank and Order? Whether it be better or worse to know that a Man is perjur'd and yet let him alone, (especially when <hi>Right and Power</hi> to make him an Example, is not wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,) or to <hi>see a Thief and consent with him,</hi> besides <hi>partak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with Adulterers,</hi> (Psal. 50.18.) is a question which with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the help of an <hi>Oedipus</hi> may be answer'd, and needs not be reserved till the coming of <hi>Elias</hi> to be resolv'd.

            <p>I am very well satisfied that I need not much trouble my self (if at all) to find out the true Cause of your lothness to imploy your <hi>Right and Power</hi> to better purpose than hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto

            <p>This to me and others being visible enough to be read running, the most painful part of my Task is to hit the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences of your negligence with so <hi>fatal a blow</hi> as may disable them from deceiving you any longer.

            <p>You are loth to disturb the Church's Peace, by putting as many Sinners to penance as may need and deserve it, <hi>lest more hurt than good should be done.</hi> Let me therefore farther ask you (repeating no more than is needful to bring me to new matter,) Have you try'd <hi>what good</hi> a gentler course and milder method (which I have not forgotten to point at in what is abovesaid) would do? If this will not help, know that <hi>the Prince of Peace came not to send</hi> (much less to settle) <hi>such a Peace on Earth,</hi> as you dream of. It was not a wicked worldly wife Peace which he labored to make, but came to break. For what kind of <hi>War,</hi> what sort of death is not
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:37307:15"/> better than such a Peace? It was not to keep the World, much less his Church, <hi>quiet on any terms whatsoever</hi> (nor on any at all which are sinful and unlawful) that he came; but to settle and establish <hi>Peace and Love with Faith</hi> (Ephes. 6.23.) and <hi>Truth (Zech.</hi> 8.9.) and to make us <hi>Followers of Peace and Holiness</hi> (Heb. 12.14.<note n="*" place="margin">Ne imperarinobis cogite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus pacem quamlibet, etiam cum dispendio veritatis &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scientiae, aut cum cujuspiam in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juria, contra <hi>Rom. 12.18.</hi> vol, quia pax cum impiis ple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rumque coli non potest, nisi vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiis ipsoruus assentiamur, se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cundum Juniam, Jacob.

For let Peace be a <hi>Jewel</hi> of as great worth as it will, Faith and Truth, Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and Holiness are, doubtless, <hi>Pearls</hi> of much greater Price. The Martyrs and Confessors of all Ages would not otherwise have paid as dear as they did for their preservation: Nor had any commendation been given them for being <hi>tortured not accepting deliverance</hi> (Heb. 11.35.) when Peace was offer'd them to the prejudice of Truth, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but on those Terms they would not have it, and are there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore deservedly extold.</p>
            <p>It was not <hi>a peace which makes God our Enemy</hi> (as the Friendship of the World is wont to do; <hi>James</hi> 4.4.) that he purposed to introduce, nor <hi>such as the World gives</hi> (a false, feigned, self-ended, pernicious peace) which generally makes People worse, and not better than without it they would be (for when is God more fogotten or forsaken, and when doth iniquity more abound, than when <hi>worldly peace</hi> is most firm and flourishing?) that he promised to <hi>bestow,</hi> and which was actually <hi>given</hi> and left for a <hi>Legacy</hi> to his Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, in some of his last words, <hi>John</hi> 14.17. <hi>Internal</hi> peace which is Armour of proof against a world of Troubles and Adversities, Tribulations and Persecutions for Righteousness sake; not <hi>external,</hi> to save us the labor of undergoing such Troubles as ever have been and ever will be incident to the Righteous (<hi>Psal.</hi> 34.19.) <hi>while the World lieth in Wickedness,</hi> is the peace that he bequeathed in that rich and inestimable Legacy. This he assured them of; This they were never destitute of: The other he never promised, but predicted the contrary (<hi>John</hi> 16.33.) that they might not expect it.
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:37307:16"/> Why then should you fear of disturbing such a peace as the <hi>Author of peace and lover of Concord</hi> never did nor ever will approve? A Peace which is little if any thing better than the confederacy of <hi>Gebal, Ammon</hi> and <hi>Amalek (Psal.</hi> 83.7.) with a multitude of other Enemies, against the People of God in King <hi>David</hi>'s days. A Peace like <hi>Herod's and Pilate's Friendship;</hi> too near of kin to the <hi>Peace of Thieves and Rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,</hi> which must not be consented to, (<hi>Prov.</hi> 1.10.) as well as too true and lively a picture of <hi>the Concord which Christ and his Apostles found among the Scribes and Pharises with the Saddu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces;</hi> who as much as they differ'd in other matters, concurr'd as unanimously in crucifying the Lord of Glory and perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting his Church, as their Father the Devil could desire.</p>
            <p>If you fear the disturbance of <hi>such peace</hi> as this, the pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Apostle who set the Council <hi>at variance (Acts</hi> 23.6.) hath taught you, by so doing, that 'tis better broken than kept. It was not to create, but annihilate such peace as this that <hi>the God of Peace</hi> sent his Son from Heaven, and he his Apostles into the World. Who indeed went abroad <hi>preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing peace by Jesus Christ, (Acts</hi> 10.36.) as St. <hi>John</hi> the Baptist his forerunner was sent <hi>to guide the Feet of his Auditors into the way of peace, (Luke</hi> 1.79.) but that, as hath been pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, was another sort of peace than what you fondly affect. Yours (which is not <hi>his,</hi> but the <hi>World's</hi>) he came not to plant but pluck up; not to preserve but destroy, as judging <hi>a Sword</hi> (Matt. 10.34.) <hi>and division (Luke</hi> 12.51.) to be much more desirable. He foresaw what Quarrels and Contentions would be raised by the <hi>Gospel of Peace</hi> it self, faithfully preached, (<hi>quia mundus ingratus mavult bella quam Evangelium. Aret. ad Apoc.</hi> 6.5.) the wicked World at that time, as well as now and ever since, rather choosing to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue in sin whatever Stirs and Wars it caused, than desiring such Peace as he himself loves and approves, which is only such as hath briefly been described, but deserves to be much more treated of, would the place and occasion give leave: He knew (what St. <hi>Jerom.</hi> on <hi>Matt.</hi> 10.34. hath noted) that as soon as the <hi>Word of Faith,</hi> which teacheth how true Peace may be attain'd, was published, the whole World would be divided; that in every House there would be <hi>cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentes
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:37307:16"/> &amp; infideles,</hi> Believers and Infidels, and that thence it would come to pass that <hi>a Man should be set at variance against his Father, the Daughter against her Mother, and the Daughter-in-Law against her Mother-in-Law,</hi> Matt. 10.34. and, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to St. <hi>Luke</hi>'s Relation, <hi>that five in one House should be divided; three against two, and two against three,</hi> Chap. 12.52. yet he would not however hide his Gospel from the World, because the faithful hearers of it were, <hi>directly and designed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> the better, whatever hurt was <hi>by accident</hi> occasioned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong Unbelievers. For what <hi>if some were harden'd?</hi> the rest who hearkened to the voice of his Messengers that came <hi>preaching peace by Jesus Christ,</hi> were no losers. The damage which the one receiv'd, was countervail'd at least, if not out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weigh'd by the others advantage. If a <hi>sinful, temporal, transi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory Peace</hi> was disturb'd, destroy'd and lost, <hi>the peace of God, which passeth all understanding</hi> was gained. And it seems not meet that <hi>the Prince of Peace</hi> himself, or <hi>the Gospel of Peace,</hi> (which at first he preached with his own Mouth, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward by his Messengers sent abroad into all the World) should be complain'd of as a sower of discord, or <hi>disturber of peace,</hi> any more than the fruit of the Vine can be blamed, because drunkenness is so common; or than Beauty can be condemned, because chambering and wantonness are no ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities. Who in his right wits would therefore say, let there be <hi>no Wine or Women,</hi> and not rather, let there be no sinful Lusts and Affections? Otherwise he may say as well, let there be no <hi>Sun, Moon, or Stars,</hi> because divers Nations have worshipt them, and some do still. As little reason there is to say, let <hi>the Prince of Peace call home his Ambassadors,</hi> and send abroad no more <hi>Heraulds</hi> to publish the Gospel of Peace; let them all keep silence and treat no more with the People of the World about the grand concerns of it, since they frequently make <hi>the better side the worse,</hi> and instead of <hi>creating peace</hi> where it was not, destroy that little of it which they find. Let it rather be said, <hi>let none love the peace of the World more than the Peace of God;</hi> and then if all be not well, here below, it will yet be much better than otherwise; and the Gospel of Christ will at last be confessed to be what we find it called, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.15. <hi>the Gospel of Peace.</hi>

            <p>If you list to know twenty things more of this matter than here there is time or room to tell you, be pleas'd to consult <hi>Chrysostom,</hi> and others on that famous passage of St. <hi>Matthew</hi>'s Evangelical History, <hi>chap.</hi> 10.34; especially that golden-mouth'd-man, whose Praises are higher than my humble phrase and shallow invention can reach. To him I suspect you to be little more than as great a Stranger as I was when first I began to look upon him; (for you name him, I find in your Preface to the <hi>Grand Case,</hi> about <hi>a Fish that hath but one Back-bone, and cannot turn except it turn all at once,</hi> (if the Crocodile is a Fish, that perhaps is the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture that he speaks of,) but you tell us not where he hath said it;) You must needs have learned somewhat more of his <hi>Zeal</hi> and fortitude than I find you to be owner of, had you been as familiar with him as a man of your age and place in the <hi>Church of England,</hi> one would think should have been. From him and others (take all the help you can in so <hi>grand a Case;</hi> as much bigger than what you have written of, as an <hi>Elephant</hi> is bigger than a <hi>Mouse,</hi>) you may learn that the Peace which Christ came to make and promote, is not <hi>such a Peace as the World which lieth in wickedness</hi> rejoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth in and seeks after; not a <hi>terrene Tranquility</hi> which gives liberty of buying, selling and getting gain; or administers opportunity of eating, drinking, and being merry, while the Follies and Vanities of the World are as freely injoy'd, as if nothing better were needful to be minded: But <hi>a Peace which the World neither doth nor can give,</hi> is that which he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed to advance. And will you, as if the Peace of the World were the Peace of Christ and his Church, neglect such a Peace as the World <hi>cannot</hi> give, for that which he <hi>will</hi> not give, <hi>but came to destroy?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Apostles themselves were strongly perswaded for a while, that their Master should reign at the rate of an <hi>earthly Monarch,</hi> and be able by external Power to force his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to a peaceable compliance with him. That they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves who had faithfully adhered to him in his low Estate should enjoy no less than the Prosperity of <hi>Princes</hi> under him, was their hope, or presumption rather. To remove so great a mistake he said, <hi>Think not that I am come to send peace on Earth: I came not to send Peace but a Sword.</hi>

            <pb n="33" facs="tcp:37307:17"/>
            <p>Which to me (whatever it doth to you and others who live at ease) sounds no less than thus: You are greatly mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staken to think, as you do, that the End of my coming is to settle you in a firm possession of <hi>temporal Peace</hi> and Prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. For what hope of this can you have when the Rage of Men and Devils will be stirred up against you, as already it is against me, for nothing else but preaching <hi>the Gospel of Peace</hi> to the World? Let no such vain thought as this lodge with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in you, but prepare your selves for Persecution, Tribula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Bonds, Imprisonment and the Sword it self, rather than dream of such a Peace.</p>
            <p>That they might not be troubled when such things hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened, he foretold them before they came to pass; and as <hi>Chrysostom</hi> notes, he said not <hi>War</hi> but a <hi>Sword,</hi> that the sharpness of his words might the better excite their Attenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and that none might say <hi>he prophesied to them smooth things only,</hi> but concealed what was rough and troublesome, for fear of losing their Company.</p>
            <p>Are you better than the Apostles, that you look to be bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter treated?

            <p>If you are not yet satisfied <hi>how vain the fear of disturbing the Church's Peace</hi> (by opposing all manner of sin and wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness) <hi>is,</hi> read farther on in the same Author, (it may, probably, provoke you to get acquaintance with the rest of his Works, as I hoped e'er now to have done, but that you and some others prevented it; <hi>you and they,</hi> I say, who should rather have helped than hindred a lover of the best learning;) and then tell me how <hi>his Doctrin</hi> (which is too clear and evident, too sound and solid to be spoken against; and is certainly <hi>according to godliness,</hi> tho' none of the likeliest to be gainful,) and <hi>your practice</hi> (which is much too sordid, servile and shameful, too cowardly and fearful to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued,) agree with each other.</p>
            <p>Before I take leave of this subject (which can never be too much inculcated, there is daily such need of it; and some besides your self, who ought to be <hi>Teachers of others</hi> having
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:37307:19"/>
               <hi>need to be taught</hi> it themselves,) I will add but this one thing more: Which, if nothing else had been or could have been said, would have served to awaken any one but you, or ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther such whom the love of <hi>worldly Peace</hi> and Prosperity hath lull'd so fast asleep, that if greater noise is not made and stir kept, than is common, you are never like, for ought I perceive, to come to your selves.</p>
            <p>That which remains to be added is this: That <hi>the Prince of Peace</hi> being the sole Judge and <hi>Arbiter of Peace,</hi> at whose will and pleasure alone it stands to give or take it away, (<hi>Pacis imponere morem,</hi> as the Prince of Latin Poets reckons, is a princely <hi>Prerogative;</hi>) you must not presume to seek, keep, or make peace without his approbation, or on any terms whatsoever which he allows not. For what peace is worth the having, which he denies to be had?</p>
            <p>If the famous <hi>Athanasius</hi> with the rest of the <hi>Orthodox,</hi> in his days, or after them, would have dared <hi>to deny the Lord that bought them,</hi> the <hi>Arians</hi> would have granted them peace: But they would not accept it on such a condition, nor yeild their adversaries as much as one <hi>Iota</hi> (in the word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>) to obtain it. Let <hi>Mahomet</hi> be held a Prophet, neither <hi>Turks</hi> nor <hi>Moors</hi> will trouble us. Let us look for <hi>another Christ,</hi> and the Jews will be our friends. Let the Church which pretends <hi>to be the Mother of us all</hi> (as unlike as she is to <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem which is above,</hi>) be submitted to, and she will not mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lest us. Let the Dreams and Dotages of Hereticks be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced <hi>for Doctrins,</hi> and they will not disquiet us. Let us do and say like the rest of our Neighbors, they will find no fault with us. Let ungodly People, who conform to <hi>Rites and Ceremonies of Man's Institution, but make light of unaltera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Rules and Duties of Religion, which clearly carry a Divine stamp and impression upon them,</hi> have their way, we may still be sure of having their company (and communion in Church-Offices) such as 'tis: On this condition they will never <hi>forsake our Assemblies</hi> for any other fellowship whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever.</p>
            <p>But whatever Peace is offer'd which <hi>the Prince of Peace</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees not to, is rather to be contemned than concluded, and as oft as you make it <hi>without his leave,</hi> it is better broken than kept, being bought at too dear a rate.</p>
            <pb n="38" facs="tcp:37307:20"/>
            <p>
               <hi>If it be possible,</hi> and <hi>as much as lieth in you,</hi> saith, his holy Apostle (<hi>Rom.</hi> 12.18.) <hi>live peaceably with all men.</hi> But it lies not alway nor altogether in us: And it is not possible many times (seldom indeed is it) to <hi>attain or maintain it</hi> by any but sinful means, which must never be chosen or sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to, if we would not <hi>do evil that good may come. Id possumus quod jure possumus.</hi> That in this case, as in others of a like nature, is <hi>possible</hi> which is <hi>lawful,</hi> and that only. If we cannot have <hi>Peace with Truth and Holiness, Peace and Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity</hi> (James 3.17.) <hi>Grace and Peace</hi> in conjunction; (<hi>Rom.</hi> 1.7.) Peace within as well as without; Peace with God and Man together, it is better to have those Christian and Christ-like qualities without Peace, than Peace without them. For it is not the <hi>Peace of God or of Christ, but of the World,</hi> which excludes them.</p>
            <p>The Church of <hi>Ephesus</hi> indeed, is commended for <hi>her pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence;</hi> (Revel. 2.2.) but her suffering Sinners to go uncen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sur'd and unreprov'd for love of ease and quietness, is no part of the Grace which Christ commends her for, but the contrary. Her patience in suffering the Reproaches, and induring the Contradictions of evil Doers <hi>whom she could not bear,</hi> is the thing that he praiseth her for. This patience if you had, you would reckon <hi>the Reproach of Christ to be grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Riches than the Treasures of Egypt</hi> (Heb. 11.26.) how much more than those of your Archdeaconry, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which would not however be diminisht, unless you take or permit your Officers to take what is not due, for over-looking the faults which you boast of having <hi>Right and Power to punish;</hi>) and not be so loth to bear it. <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.13.</p>
            <p>What shall I more say? Or what can you say more (which hath not hitherto been <hi>weighed in the ballance</hi> and <hi>found too light,</hi>) to justifie the Reception of such <hi>Right and Power,</hi> as you talk of, to no better purpose than hitherto you have had it?</p>
            <p>Is the <hi>Noble Army of Martyrs</hi> already so great that it needs not be increased? Never fear; The King of Glory hath Crowns enough for ten thousand times as many more: And it is but folly to think of being saved on much easier, if at all more easie terms now than formerly.</p>
            <pb n="39" facs="tcp:37307:20"/>
            <p>
               <hi>The Danger of Martyrdom,</hi> if St. <hi>Chrysostom</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">Tom. <hi>4.</hi> Hom. <hi>25.</hi> ad Popul. Bern. Brix. inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prete.</note> may be cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dited, <hi>is alway present to good People:</hi>
               <q>And that any Age since Christian Religion was first propagated hath wanted store of Martyrs, is more to be attributed to Negligence, Ignorance and Hypocrisie, or want of Courage in Christ's Embassadors, or appointed Pastors, than to the sincerity, mildness or fidelity of the flock; especially of the Bell-weathers or Ring-leaders. Or if Satan had not abated the Edge of primitive Zeal and Resolution, by that dishono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Peace concluded between Christianity and Gentilism, after the setling of Goths and Vandals in these parts of Christendom; had he not utterly benumb'd Mankind by locking up their spiritual Senses in a Midnight Darkness, and fettering their Souls in superstition since the time that he himself was let loose: <hi>Rome</hi> Christian had seen <hi>more Martyrs</hi> (even of those who did not much dissent from her in most Opinions held within six hundred Years after Christ,) in one year, than <hi>Rome</hi> heathen had known in ten. Even in Churches best reform'd it would be much easier, I think to find store of just matter for Martyrdom, than of Men fit to make Martyrs. And he that hath lived any long time in these quiet Mansions and Seats<note n="*" place="margin">Those which belong to <hi>Oxford</hi> University are the Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which he means.</note> hath great cause either to magnifie the tender Mercies of his gracious God, or suspect himself for an Hypocrite, if he have not suffered some Degree of Martyrdom.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Thus that Eminent Dr. lately prais'd, hath <hi>in terminis,</hi> deliver'd his Thoughts of the Case under consideration, §. 2. Chap. 4. <hi>p.</hi> 185, 186, of justifying Faith. To which I will add the Judgment of another, no less pious, considering and considerable <hi>Author:</hi> A Man no less famous for profun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity of Judgment than sharpness of Wit; and so far from <hi>hiding his Talent,</hi> (tho' but few of his Works are extant) that <hi>his Chamber was a Church and his Chair a Pulpit,</hi> as one that well knew him hath told the World, in a short account of his Life.</p>
            <p>What said this great and good Man? Take his own words, (in his Sermon of St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Fall, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> bound up with some other Discourses, and called his <hi>Golden Remains:</hi> Pag. 119, 120.) <q>We usually distinguish the Times of the Church, into Times of Peace and Times of Persecution:
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:37307:21"/> The truth is, to a true Christian Man the Times are alway the same. <hi>Habet etiam pax suos Martyres,</hi> saith one. There is a Martyrdom even in time of peace. For the practice of a Christian Man in the calmest times, in readiness and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution, must nothing differ from times of rage and fire. —Mark, I beseech you, what I say. I will not affirm; I will only leave it to your Christian discretion. A tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary Faith—a Faith that fails as soon as it feels the heat of Persecution, can save no Man. May we not with some reason think that the Faith of many a one who in time of peace seems to us, yea and to himself too peradventure to die possest of it, is yet notwithstanding no better than a temporary Faith, and therefore comes not so far as to save him that hath it? —If God, to try who are his, should bring on us those Temptations which would make a Man of temporary Faith to shrink, think we that all those who in these times of peace have born the Name of Christ to their Graves, would have born it to the Rack, the Sword, the Fire? Indeed to Man, who knows not the thoughts of his Friend, some Trials are sometimes very necessary: But he that knew and foretold <hi>David</hi> what the resolution of the men of <hi>Keilah</hi> would be, if <hi>Saul</hi> came to them; knows likewise what the resolution of every one of us would be if a fiery Trial should appear. Who knows therefore whether God hath not numbred out the Crowns of Life according to the number of their Souls who he foreknew would in the midst of all Temptations and Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als continue unto the End? For what difference is there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the Faith <hi>that fails</hi> upon occasion, or that <hi>would fail</hi> if occasion were offer'd? —Deceive not your selves: <hi>Heaven never was, nor ever will be gotten without Martyrdom.</hi>
               </q> (Pag. 121.) <hi>in resolution, at least,</hi> as before and after these passages he explains his meaning, <hi>every one that intends to be saved must be a Martyr.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If this be <hi>sound Doctrin,</hi> which you cannot disprove, let your present purpose, if you think your self resolv'd, be examin'd by what you have formerly done (or omitted shall I say?) You that have <hi>feared the Reproach of men whom the Moth shall eat up like a Garment, and been afraid of their Revilings whom the worm shall eat like wool</hi> (Isa. 51.7, 8.) for
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:37307:21"/> what else hath kept you from putting forth your <hi>Right and Power of correcting and reforming,</hi> &amp;c. to bring Sinners to repentance? or what more than this could they do to deter you?) You that have <hi>loved the Praise of Men more than the Praise of God,</hi> (John 12.43.) and have rather chosen to be honour'd among the ungodly (for letting them alone in their sins) than to <hi>seek the Honour that cometh from God only,</hi> (John 5.44.) You that have sought <hi>the world's Peace</hi> that profits as little as Wealth <hi>in the day of wrath,</hi> more than <hi>the Peace of God,</hi> which is greater Wealth than words can ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press; and have suffered evil Doers to grow worse and worse, for fear of suffering (I know not what) by doing your best to make them better: You (to conclude) who have been so far from <hi>taking up a Cross,</hi> of your own accord (as a learned man<note n="*" place="margin">Dr. <hi>Hide</hi> in his Christian Legacy. <hi>pag.</hi> 109.</note> hath observed the proper sense of our Saviour's word <gap reason="foreign">

            <p>By this time I hope the <hi>Cacata Charta</hi> is pretty well cleans'd, and better canvas'd than when <hi>you and your fellow Censors</hi> had it in hand. Wise men wonder'd, and still do, that you were not asham'd to take it up and foul your Fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers with it as you did. If you have not your belly full, <hi>you'l never be satisfied.</hi> Yet I cannot desist without asking you farther, what is Hypocrisie, if to scruple <hi>small,</hi> and swallow <hi>great sins</hi> (or to boggle at <hi>trifles</hi> and not scruple real <hi>tres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passes</hi>) deserves not the Name? What is <hi>double iniquity,</hi> if Hypocrisie is not? What is Irreligion if <hi>Injustice</hi> be not? And what is Injustice, if <hi>over-much Righteousness,</hi> tho' accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to Law (much more a pretence of being <hi>righteous</hi> in calling any thing a fault which is not the <hi>transgression of any Law,</hi>) is another and not the same thing? And what is evil, if to <hi>have respect of Persons in judgment</hi> is good? What indeed is <hi>abominable,</hi> if this be <hi>tolerable?</hi> For tho' the Text (<hi>Prov.</hi> 24.23.) only tells you <hi>it is not good</hi>— Yet your Rhetoric-Rules have told you, I presume, of a Figure, frequent in Scripture (call it <hi>Liptote, Litote, Tapinosis, Meiosis,</hi> or how you will, if neither of those old Names will please you,) which expresseth <hi>hard things</hi> many times by <hi>soft words;</hi> weighty and lofty matters <hi>in low, diminutive terms</hi> and hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble phrases; leaving more to be understood than is spoken, the Language being <hi>milder</hi> than the full sense of the matter. [So the meaning of <hi>not holding guiltless,</hi> in the Third Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment, is to punish severely: Not to <hi>leave comfortless</hi> (John 14.18.) is to give the richest Cordial that a faint and languishing Spirit can have to revive it. <hi>Not to quench,</hi> is to quicken and inflame; not <hi>to bruise or break,</hi> (Isa. 42.3.) to bind up: <hi>Not to be asham'd</hi> (Rom. 1.16.) to confess with boldness: <hi>Not to be weak in Faith</hi> (Rom. 4.19.) to be firm and stedfast <hi>without staggering through unbelief:</hi> Not to <hi>work evil</hi> (Rom. 13.10.) is to do as much good as the <hi>fulfilling of the whole Law</hi> amounts to. In 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.4, 5, 6. within the compass of three Verses, no less than eight Examples of this kind are met with. <hi>Tali sermonis figura totus Decalogus constat,</hi> saith a man<note n="*" place="margin">Flac.

               </note> well skill'd in those Affairs.] Thus the Phrase of <hi>not being good</hi> signifies very bad, extremely
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:37307:24"/> evil, or stark naught. As bad, if you will, as the <hi>Figs</hi> which the Prophet saw in a Vision, (<hi>Jer.</hi> 24.2.) <hi>which could not be eaten, they were so very bad.</hi> To render it as bad as bad can be, we meet with the <hi>same phrase</hi> many times over, in the Book of <hi>Proverbs;</hi> sometimes indeed it is applied to different mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, (<hi>Prov.</hi> 19.2. <hi>Prov.</hi> 25.27.) but oftner to the Case in hand, than any other. <hi>Prov.</hi> 17.26.18.5.28.21. And why is it spoken so often against in this single Book of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, notwithstanding those many prohibitions by which it is elsewhere forbidden, but for one or other, or rather for both these reasons:</p>
            <p n="1">1. That people are so prone to offend in this manner.</p>
            <p n="2">2. To render them the more watchful against a sin which <hi>so easily besets them.</hi> To which this may be added,</p>
            <p n="3">3. That these frequent, reiterated prohibitions are used to shew how much the Most High hates it.</p>
            <p>In the place last pointed at, (<hi>Prov.</hi> 28.21.) it is said, That a sinner of this sort will <hi>transgress for a piece of Bread,</hi> i. e. <hi>munere vilissimo, minima lucrandi occasione data.</hi> For the smallest reward, he will <hi>justifie the wicked;</hi> the least tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which can come in his way, will turn him aside from judging righteously, who gives place to partiality and is sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to the sin of <hi>respecting persons in Judgment.</hi> Tho' he loves not Mony; needs not Gold or Silver, regards not Gifts or Presents, he hath Friends or Passions to be gratified, hath Love or Hatred, Fear or Anger, or some other exor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitant Affection to over-rule him. Let the <hi>merit of the Cause</hi> be what it will, his main care is to please his <hi>Superiors</hi> (whose favor he more values than <hi>God</hi>'s) in passing sentence. The <hi>rich and potent</hi> he will not offend, for fear of losing their favor, who may help him at a dead-lift another time. The <hi>poor,</hi> who can do him no hurt, (as he vainly presumes, many times) he despiseth and oppresseth, as if <hi>Justice and Judgment</hi> and <hi>Equity</hi> were too good for them. And when matters are thus carried (as alway they are where <hi>Respect of Persons</hi> bears sway; when <hi>Dives</hi> is honor'd and favor'd for the sake of <hi>his purple and fine linnen; Lazarus</hi> abus'd and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temn'd because of his rags and sores (whatever right he hath on his side, or whatever good qualities are in him which his wealthier Adversary wants,) is not this to value Gold more
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:37307:25"/> than Grace? perishing things, above permanent? temporal, more than spiritual and eternal riches?</p>
            <p>If it is not so, shew the contrary. If it is, cast up your Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts, (comparing them with <hi>a Special Account,</hi> &amp;c. former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly given) and see what you have gotten by your palpable partiality in favoring the <hi>furious</hi> (I could justly say worse) Man, <hi>who hath stirred up all this strife.</hi>

            <p>I am not fond or ambitious (much less proud) of your company, Sir! nor at all delighted in it on this occasion, tho' I tarry so long with you; (longer by far than at first set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting forth to give you this <hi>Visit,</hi> was purposed.

<pb n="49" facs="tcp:37307:25"/> agitating, the Work fervent, and the Iron hot, in hope of striking up a Bargain; and who were imploy'd to help ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer it out, till at last <hi>a bungling Ignoramus,</hi> who neither knew how <hi>to hold or use</hi> his hand or tongue, came in and spoil'd all.

            <p>What! not altho' you had promis'd it <hi>over and over?</hi> Was it lawful to say again and again, that you <hi>would,</hi> and sinful <hi>to do</hi> as you had said?</p>

A great Minister of State indeed thought it folly, and not policy, <hi>to be a slave</hi> (as his word was) <hi>to his Word:</hi> must you needs become his disciple, that fidelity may be <hi>slavery</hi> in your opinion likewise? If the Case be so, take heed of the Mark which the People of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples</hi> have long been known by; who for promising much, and doing little, are said to have <hi>wide mouths and narrow hands.</hi> What will it profit you to be like them? Change as oft as you list, oftner if you can than <hi>the Moon</hi> changeth her figure, or <hi>the French</hi> their fashions; Vice and Vertue, Good and Evil will still be the same.

               <q>But this <hi>(to speak at large of Scripture Examples and Histories, tho' named occasionally for proof of the principal thing propounded to be spoken of,)</hi> is not to go from it.

Therefore it is that we take such pain to make you ashamed of your faults, using divers methods and forms of Speech, seeing much sickness is probably found among much people; and it is not our purpose to cure this or that single Patient only, but many and various sin-sick Souls.

For it is not my purpose, nor was it when first I began, to discover your Disease only, but <hi>to bleed and purge and bring down your proud flesh,</hi> as low as a <hi>tertian Ague</hi> can lay it, for your better recovery. Not barely to relate your <hi>double-dealing,</hi> but to descant upon it in such sort as may make you to see the more clearly <hi>how hateful</hi> it is, (not despairing but that in time you may be reconciled to <hi>Plain-Dealing,</hi>) was and is my design. To this I have kept, and from this I will no more depart than you have kept your Word. You never made a greater digression from any Text, I am confident, than this your turning back or starting aside from your promise, was. Your <hi>starting aside like a broken or deceitful Bow,</hi> (Psal. 78.57.) which seems sound and true to the Eye, but in tryal breaks or proves false. <hi>Had your heart been right, you had doubtless been more stedfast.</hi> (Ibid. <hi>v.</hi> 37.)</p>
            <p>You desir'd to know, <hi>whether any part of the Book before-mention'd, concern'd you?</hi> All the Answer given to that que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:37307:26"/> was, <hi>That if you had sooner been discours'd, something had been otherwise written than it was.</hi> (Which was spoken upon a wrong supposition, as since it hath appeared, of your being in earnest.)

            <p>So far I went till I took you aside to talk a little seriously of it. But in that, I confess, I was somewhat too nimble for the story.

            </p>
            <p>But to come to the special matter of your Bill, the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents of which would indeed be <hi>scandalous</hi> with a witness to the really religious, should those false accusers who fram'd and promoted it, escape unpunisht. I who have more reason to know the sense and meaning of the <hi>Book</hi> complain'd of, than any body else, can no more find a word from the first to the last letter of it, tending to the <hi>Scandal of the Christian Religion or Church of</hi> England, (especially to the disparage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the <hi>Government and Governors of the Church, State and Common-wealth of the Kingdom of</hi> England,) than I know where to find a solid Argument for <hi>Lay-Elders</hi> in any of your Writings; or in what place or upon what occasion it was that Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ever said, <hi>Hast thou but one blessing, O my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther!</hi> as somebody, within these 500 Years, too apt to find fault where none is, many times, as at other times, to let no small offences go unpunishht, is notoriously known to have mistaken.</p>
            <p>For what? Is the Christian Religion scandaliz'd by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving sin, as I have done, or by letting it alone, like you? If to bring hypocrisie, double-dealing, oppression, pretended Justice, Avarice, Ambition, Ungodliness and Wrong into hatred and contempt, is to make this only true Religion <hi>odious,</hi> I have reason to cry <hi>Peccavi:</hi> If not, there are many more besides your self to whom it better belongs. Which, unless your <hi>Will</hi> had been more in fault than your <hi>Eyes,</hi> you must needs have seen. For what iniquity is more crying or provoking, more frequently blamed or prohibited than that wrong-dealing which I have not spared to represent (as much as you hate to hear of it,) because you spared not to give so great and provoking an occasion? Which when you had done, how could you think me <hi>stupid enough</hi> to sit down and say nothing? Where could you imagin I should find
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:37307:29"/>
               <hi>patience enough</hi> to forbear speaking? Or how can you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that any mortal man who knows what to say, is — <hi>tam ferreus ut teneat se,</hi> so made of iron that he can possibly hold, when so great violence is used to break his meekness of spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, lowliness of heart, humbleness of mind and all, into pieces?</p>
            <p>Was it not for Men of your Rank and Order <hi>to know Judgment?</hi> Mic. 3.1. If you knew it, was it tolerable to turn aside from it to the right hand or the left? How much worse was it <hi>to turn judgment into wormwood</hi> (Amos 5.7.) <hi>and gall,</hi> and <hi>the fruit of righteousness into hemlock,</hi> (Amos 6.12.) by making it bitter and distastful, and as much as in you lay, destructive and deadly, without and against reason? And that which is yet more odious, <hi>to make judgment spring up as hemlock, in the furrows of the field,</hi> (Hos. 10.4.) where nothing, one would think, but the purest and finest Corn should have grown, when the ground had been drest and prepar'd with so much care and cost, in hope of its bringing forth better fruit? If you know not that the want of <hi>Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Justice</hi> is so great irreligion, that when the one <hi>runs not down like waters</hi> and the other <hi>as a mighty stream,</hi> being clear and clean and free in their passage as running water useth to be; (<hi>clear</hi> and clean without <hi>hypocrisie, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiality</hi> or any other <hi>filthiness</hi> intermingl'd; <hi>free</hi> by the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of <hi>delay</hi> to hinder their course, as well as of <hi>might, malice and violence,</hi> or any other cursed cause to turn them aside;) all Sacrifices and Services<note n="‖" place="margin">Be they Legal or Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical; or if any odds there be, the case is now worse than formerly, more being given to us, and more requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of us, than of legal Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shippers under the Old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament. <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.20.</note> are but lost labor, and not only so, but provocations too, (turning <hi>Songs and Melody,</hi> vocal and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strumental Church-Musick into harsh and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grateful Noises; <hi>Amos</hi> 5.23, 24. If you know not this) with a hundred other things by which the Prophets of old stirred up the false, hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>critical Jews <hi>to do justly, to love mercy, and to walk humbly with God,</hi> (Mic. 6.8.) that their whole Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion might not be confin'd to the cheap and easie observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>empty Ceremonies,</hi> while the <hi>great things</hi> of the moral Law were neglected: If you know not these things, I say, <hi>search the Scriptures</hi> and study them better, (as, unless your violent persecuting hands and tongues had hindred me, I
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:37307:29"/> had certainly done,) and then, I hope, you'l be convinced how great hypocrisie you were guilty of, in stumbling at a straw (as once already I have told you, but must say it again, your heed having been so little,) and <hi>straining so hard at a gnat;</hi> or rather at the dream and shadow of so small an Animal. Not to punish real Vice and Wickedness by the <hi>true and indifferent</hi>
               <note n="†" place="margin">Pray mark that pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage; It was borrowed from a Prayer appointed to be u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed after Sermon, and not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; as once, with more confidence than evidence you asserted, in opposition to a graver Divine than your self. If this be your way of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structing the Clergy of your Archdeaconry, there's no great matter lost, I see, by not having your company.</note>
               <hi>ministra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Justice,</hi> is greater ungodliness than one body's Pen or Tongue can easily express: but to feign and pretend, that Justice weighs in <hi>her Scale,</hi> or strikes with <hi>her Sword,</hi> what <hi>her Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity</hi> scorns to meddle with, (as being too light and ridiculous for her sacred hand to touch:) This, which none can deny to be hypocrisie, hath long since been confessed to be <hi>double ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity;</hi> which whoso dares <hi>own,</hi> I would not give <hi>a brass farthing</hi> to be told what metal his brow is made of. Yet the mischief is, that few or no people <hi>hate reproof</hi> as much as hypocrites. Being <hi>desirous of vain-glory,</hi> and making a shew of greater sanctity than they have or care to be owners of, they abhor to be evil-spoken of, tho' they never so much deserve it. The most sacred things they will abuse to the vilest purposes; (like those <hi>Brethren in iniquity,</hi> Gen. 34. who obtruded <hi>an Ordinance of Divine institution</hi> on the <hi>Sichemites,</hi> to make it an instrument of sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfying their blood-thirsty rage.) how much bolder will they make with the <hi>names</hi> of sacred things? insomuch as that <hi>Justice</hi> it self cannot, many times, secure her name from being imposed upon what is no more like her, than Heaven and Hell are like each other. The most upright, faithful and true-hearted people they hate most of all, as being most unlike them. Witness the Scribes and Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sees, who as much leaven'd with hypocrisie as they were, would not suffer a mouth <hi>in which there was no guile</hi> to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend them. Judge then how weak your Cause was, in defence of which you had not a word to say, but what hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrisie helped you to.</p>
            <p>I could tarry much longer with you, on this occasion, but that you have made such a foul House, that there is not a Room or corner of a Room belonging to it but what needs
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:37307:30"/> to be cleansed; tho' I shall not need such a <hi>Scavenger,</hi> I hope, as the King of <hi>Elis</hi> procur'd to make clean his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous, or rather, fabulous Stall, which was able, as the story goes, to hold no less than three thousand Bullocks. For my thoughts, tell me, that by this time, at least, you begin to wish your Bill (and Libel too) had been a Fable, Stall, Stable, or any thing, but what it is; and that no body but <hi>Augeas, Hercules,</hi> and the like <hi>poetical people,</hi> had been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd in it. But <hi>(sero sapiunt Phryges)</hi> there's another sort of People (I wish they were only to be found among hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then Poets, like the <hi>two Gentlemen</hi> last named,) who will not learn without beating. If your caution hath been for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly too little, take better heed hereafter of being like them. And whatever you do, (let your Pen as soon be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in hand to write of <hi>presbyterated and unpresbyterated Churches</hi> yet again, as be guilty of what next follows,) be sure that from this day forward you never concur to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vise <hi>a malicious, scandalous, abusive Bill of Indictment</hi> against any man for reproving the Sins and Vices by which the Christian Religion is really disgraced, as if he, and not you, were in such a Case worthy to be made an Example.</p>
            <p>This you have done by me; and for this I challenge you, to shew me a man of this or any Function, by whom that only true Religion has been less disgraced than by me, or who by Life and Doctrin hath more labor'd to honor and bring it into credit.</p>
            <p>There are at this time, no doubt, (as in all Ages of the Church there have been) too many of those <hi>qui vitia sub obtentu nominis (Christiani)</hi>

            <p>To pass by these Complaints, I say, with as much brevity as is possible, and to speak not a word of ten times more, no less grievous, which in those Books may be met with; if you will not give, I will not fear or spare to take the liberty of transcribing this one<note n="*" place="margin">Lib. <hi>3.</hi> p. <hi>81, 82.</hi> Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve &amp; Luctuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sum est quod dicturus sum.

The Church of God it self, which ought to please him in all things, what doth it but exasperate and provoke him? Or, besides a very few who depart from evil, what is the</hi> whole Company almost <hi>of Christians, but a sink or heap of Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces? For how many can be found in the Church, who are not ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Drunkards, or Gluttons, or Adulterers, or Fornicators, Rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, or Extortioners, or Riotous Ruffians, or Thieves, or Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therers? And that which is worse than all this, There is almost no end of their Faults. For I appeal to the Consciences of all Christians, how many of them are not guilty of one or other of these hainous Offences and Villanies which have been named? or how many have not sinned in all these respects? For 'tis easier to find a sinner that is guilty of</hi> all, <hi>than</hi> none <hi>of these crimes. And where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as I said</hi> none, <hi>tho' it seems a too grievous censure, I will say much more: It is easier not only to find those that are guilty of</hi> all <hi>than guiltless of</hi> any; <hi>but easier to find examples of the greater than the less offences; that is, easier to find those that have committed the greater crimes without the less, than the less only, without the greater. For the whole Common-people belonging to the Church are well-nigh come to that shameful degree of debaucht manners, that it generally seems a sort of sanctity to be</hi> less vicious <hi>than the worst.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>How much better is it in these days than in those it was? Very little, I fear; if not in all respects before-mention'd, yet in others at least. If some capital Crimes are now more feared, because the danger of committing them is greater, the Punishment severer, are not other no less damnable Sins
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:37307:31"/> (tho' less punishable by human Laws) as much or more lov'd and liv'd in? If any sort of disgraceful or dishonorable Wickedness is left, are not other more <hi>gentile and creditable Sins</hi> (according to the common account,) taken up? If some are grown <hi>out of fashion,</hi> are not others as bad come into their places?</p>
            <p>If the swinish dirty Sins (which in <hi>Salvian</hi>'s days were so generally delighted in) are at this Time forsaken by more than adhere to them and take pleasure in them, (which is questionable,) are not <hi>the dryer Sins</hi> of oppressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Extortion, Injustice and Wrong; <hi>the unnatural</hi> Sin of Avarice (which no Bodies constitution can be blamed for inclining him to; the Sin which makes Mony to be better lov'd than Vertue, and Grace to be less esteem'd than Gold;) <hi>the provoking</hi> Sin of Perjury, <hi>the defenceless</hi> Sin of Common-swearing, which no <hi>Apology</hi> worth the hearing can be made for, <hi>the more spiritual and refined Wickedness</hi> of Pride, Ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Hatred, Envy, Malice, Hypocrisie, Partiality and Flattery; are not these, I pray, as common as ever? With respect to these, we may truly say,
<q>

            <p>He can see but little, if at all, who sees not <hi>that the whole World</hi> (the Christian part of it not excepted) <hi>lieth in wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edness,</hi> as surely now as in elder Times; little, if any thing less than in <hi>Salvian</hi>'s Age, or St. <hi>John</hi>'s Days, when his words last recited were penn'd, 1 <hi>John</hi> 5.19. It is nothing more than what Protestant as well as Popish, and Popish as well as Protestant Writers and Preachers have often com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain'd of, as might here be shewed, but that you cannot more desire to hear, than I do to see the Conclusion of this whole matter. Which is, briefly, this. The remembrance of these things (which I somewhat suspect have been seldo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer consider'd by you than me,) hath cost me very many <hi>both sad and great thoughts of heart:</hi> And must you needs go about to make me one of those by whom the Christian
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:37307:32"/> World is made worse, when as nothing in the World would rejoyce me more, than to see it as good as it needs and ought to be?</p>
            <p>Who can be to seek what mettle such a brow is made of? Hereafter, I hope, the pain that I have taken to make you a better Archdeacon than thus far you have been, will be better requited.</p>
            <p>From the <hi>Christian Religion</hi> you descend to the <hi>Church of England, as by Law establisht, and the Government and Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors of the Church, State and Commonwealth,</hi> &amp;c. as if I had likewise <hi>devised and maliciously intended to scandalize and bring into hatred and contempt no fewer than all these, among the Lieg-People and Subjects of our Soveraign Lord,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Where, <hi>O deceitful Tongue! Who lovest all devouring words and lying rather than to speak Righteousness,</hi> (Psal. 52.) where, I say, have I written, printed or caused any Word to be prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, which the greatest Malice (if greater than that by which <hi>this Bill</hi> was framed, can be found,) is able to wrest and interpret to so vile and wretched a sense and purpose?</p>
            <p>Shew me the place, if thou canst, unless thou hadst rather be <hi>indicted,</hi> denounc'd and proclaim'd for the most malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, mischievous, false, deceitful and devouring Tongue that ever I heard speak. I have spoken indeed against those lewd, profane, superstitious and ungodly People, who worship <hi>the Name of Jesus</hi> with their Knees but profane it with their Tongues; have <hi>Gloria Patri,</hi> &amp;c. very often in their mouths, but dishonour <hi>the most blessed Trinity</hi> much oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner in their Lives, being <hi>abominable and disobedient,</hi> if not also <hi>to every good Work reprobate.</hi> They who make light of <hi>God's Laws</hi> while they are, or would seem, very strict in observing <hi>the Commandments of men,</hi> having little or no Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion but what consisteth <hi>in Conformity to Church-Rites and Ceremonies,</hi> as if this would excuse their <hi>Non-conformity</hi> to those elder and nobler Laws which God himself was Author of: These, I say, I have not spared (as you with your <hi>Right and Power of punishing, correcting and reforming,</hi> have done;) as appears by the Preface to <hi>a Special Account of Wrongs,</hi> &amp;c. to which you are no stranger, <hi>pag.</hi> 2, 3. If in any thing, on that occasion, I have given offence, it could only be by saylng <hi>too little</hi> and not too much against them.
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:37307:32"/> For who deserve to be blam'd if these are worthy to be past by? Who but these ulcerous, rotten Members of our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion (unless they are timely cur'd, or otherwise handl'd, if that cannot be,) threaten the whole Body with infection and worse? What worse Enemies, whatever kindness they pretend, can <hi>the Church of England</hi> have? Who but they, or who more than they, hinder it from being one of the happiest <hi>National Churches</hi> in Christendom? It is <hi>strange blindness</hi> which sees not, stranger impudence which knows and yet denies that these are the People who have <hi>turn'd her glory into shame,</hi> deform'd her beauty, and kept her from <hi>growing as the Lilly, and casting forth her roots as Lebanon,</hi> Hos. 14.5. Who then can think it brought into contempt by declaiming against the Vices of ungodly People (altho' it were done with a Voice as loud as Thunder, were it possible) and not rather by letting them alone in their Sins, until, like a <hi>true generation of Vipers,</hi> they eat out the Bowels of the Church which bred them, as once already they have done.</p>
            <p>Sir! Be sure to repent of this horrible Hypocrisie (for which you must shortly give account <hi>to Him that is ready to judge both the quick and dead,</hi>) as much as ever you repented of any thing that ever you preached or printed in all your life hitherto; or expect to be paid what you cannot but know your self to have deserved.</p>
            <p>One would think you had pretty well fed and feasted your malicious hungry appetite of taking revenge, by char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing me with a malicious design of <hi>bringing the Christian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion and Church of</hi> England <hi>into hatred and contempt;</hi> but you stop not there: but as greedy gluttons know not when to leave eating, (or like wretched people who are subject to perpetual hunger, that sad Disease which Physicians call <hi>Bulimia,</hi>) and as <hi>Cowards</hi> are implacable and insatiably <hi>cruel</hi> when they find opportunity; so you go on, adding (<hi>drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenness to thirst,</hi> Deut. 29.19.) slander to slander, a third and fourth Calumny to the first and second, (whether with greater malice or falshood is not easily told,) as if you ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily thought that <hi>Machiavel's Maxim, [Calumniare fortiter, adhaerebit aliquid:</hi> which I know not what practitioner of his Politicks hath thus Englished, <hi>Give him an ill Name, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>body will believe it,</hi>] because it hath often been effectual, would
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:37307:33"/> never fail. For next you accuse me of devising and design<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>to scandalize and bring into contempt and hatred the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Governors of the Church and State of the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth of the Kingdom of</hi> England.</p>
            <p>But how <hi>impotent</hi> this part of your <hi>Bill</hi> is (to say no worse) the Book it self shews to your shame. For in what Line or Leaf, Page or Paragraph can you meet with any passage which but seems to look that way? Clear thine eyes, <hi>Zoilus!</hi> and look as narrowly as thou canst; muster thy forces, <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus!</hi> and call in all the aid thou canst get to find it out; Whet thy tongue, <hi>Doeg!</hi> if it is not yet sharp enough, and speak the worst thou canst truly say of the worst Word or Sentence in the whole composure. But think not that grave and indifferent Judges will take malice and impudence for sufficient proof and evidence.</p>
            <p>If you and they with whom you acted in heaping upon me the <hi>Wrongs and Abuses complain'd of in the Book,</hi> are the <hi>Governors,</hi> and your manner of dealing (in the Instances given) is <hi>the Government of the Church of</hi> England; I have not omitted, indeed, to relate your Proceedings, not to bring you into hatred and contempt however, but to let you see somewhat better, I hope, than otherwise you had seen, how much reason you have to hate the like Courses hereafter, as well as to make amends for what is past. What's this to the <hi>Government of the Church</hi> (by <hi>Archbishops, Bishops, Deans, Archdeacons,</hi> &amp;c. according to the Sixth of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons and Constitutions set forth in 1640, or what do you mean?) or how are the <hi>Governors</hi> of the Church concern'd in it otherwise than to call you to account for your scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous Partiality and Hypocrisie, which as many as are lovers of the Wisdom that comes from above must needs be offended at?</p>
            <p>One or other that should see the <hi>Bill</hi> and not the <hi>Book</hi> upon which it is pretended to be grounded, would be ready to think that I had written an Appendix to <hi>Martin-Mar-Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late,</hi> or called the <hi>Governement and Governors</hi> whom you speak of, <hi>Antichristian,</hi> intolerable and abominable to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them as <hi>odious and contemptible</hi> as I could: but when both are compar'd, a judicious Reader will quickly be convinc'd on which side the fault lies. For as soon may <hi>Oyl be squeez'd
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:37307:33"/> out of a Flint,</hi> or I know not what <hi>rare Spirit</hi> by <hi>Chymical ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction</hi> fetcht out of a <hi>Pumice-stone,</hi> as a word of that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture found in the <hi>Book,</hi> though you rack and force, strain and sublimate every Sentence and Syllable in it with your utmost skill.</p>
            <p>You may think, for ought I know, that whatever a <hi>Bishop</hi> or <hi>Archdeacon</hi> saith, must <hi>pass for an Oracle;</hi> or that all which the one or other doth, is fit to be made a Precedent for the present and future Ages, lest <hi>the Government and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernors of the Church should be scandaliz'd,</hi> &amp;c. But if such ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations please you (who can help it?) you must e'en be content to sit down and think by your self alone, few or none having either so much time to spare, or so little wit to guide them, as in such a case would be requisite to make them fit companions for you.</p>
            <p>As occasion served, I reflected indeed on the time when <hi>the Church of England</hi> was under water, tho' not drowned, — <hi>pag.</hi> 39th of the <hi>Spec. Account.</hi> (Consider by the way, who brought her so low, and excuse the Members of her own Communion if you can.) To that Passage this was added, in the Margent: [If another <hi>Storm,</hi> like that which we read of in St. <hi>Matth.</hi> 8.24. <hi>should arise and cover the ship with waves,</hi> (which God forbid, tho' the sins of too many Mariners and Passengers are many and great enough to justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie such a fear;) yet that still it may truly be said,
<q>Fluctuat at nunquam mergitur illa ratis,</q> the Ship is tossed but not sunk, shall be mine as, it ought to be every one's Prayer.]</p>
            <p>Was it there that the <hi>Government and Governors of the Church were spoken against?</hi> If it was, make it out. <gap reason="foreign">

            <p>The <hi>Chymists</hi> (with whom you would sometimes seem to be somewhat inward) use to lock up their meaning in my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stical words which abundance of Readers cannot tell what to make of; (some think the Authors themselves understood
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:37307:34"/> not themselves.) Have I done the like and not kept as close to the terms of <hi>Plain-dealing,</hi> as the Title oblig'd me? Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover it if I have. If not, I must give you another <hi>Call to repentance,</hi> for <hi>travelling with iniquity, conceiving mischief, and bringing forth falshood,</hi> Psal. 7.14. Is this to be mindful of <hi>whatsoever things are true, just, honest, pure, lovely, vertuous, and of good report?</hi> (Phil. 4.8.) and not rather to cast them behind your back and tread them under your feet as unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of your company? And if this be to walk according to that golden Rule, (<hi>Whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do ye even so to them,</hi> Matth. 7.12.) what is it to walk as directly contrary to it as your feet can carry you? The Rule, you know, was made by the best and greatest <hi>Law-giver</hi> that ever lived on Earth, and was publickly deliver'd in the best Sermon that ever was preached. The Justice, Equity and Truth of it has been confessed by all that ever heard it. <hi>Severus the Emperor</hi> was so greatly pleas'd with it that on all occasions to which it is proper (which are not a few) he had it in his mouth. On the Walls of his Palaces and Publick Buildings he caus'd it to be written; chose it for the Motto of his Banners, and gave order to have it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim'd by his Heraulds when any of his Soldiers or other Subjects were condemned to be punished with death or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise (according to the nature of the Crime) <hi>for doing Wrong.</hi> This Sentence, had you heeded it (in hope that you'l better remember it hereafter, I have said and will say the more of it,) would have made you less <hi>active</hi> in find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fault without Cause (as above-said) and a great deal more willing to be <hi>passive</hi> in hearing your own real faults related, without studying and seeking Revenge, as both City and Country can tell you have done, whatever (to make it the worse) you promised to the contrary.</p>
            <p>Will you hear what a late Author has discoursed in his application of the <hi>Golden Rule</hi> before prais'd to several pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses and occurrences of Life? Like or leave it, thus it is<note n="*" place="margin">

If he does, He tells
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:37307:34"/> you farther of a Chancery or Court of Equity within him to reverse the Proceedings and revenge the Contempt of its Authority.</q> Shortly; That the Nature of the Rule right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly applied, <q>Is to determin us to just and righteous, to fair and candid and ingenuous dealings.</q> And to press the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation of it the better, among other advantages to be reaped by keeping close to it, names this for one, (<hi>pag.</hi> 76.) That (tho' this single Precept, of doing as we would be done unto, is far from being the sum of all Religion, as some (whom he calls) conceited Moralists would have it esteem'd: (<hi>pag.</hi> 18.) whereas in truth it only comprehends in few words what the <hi>Law and the Prophets</hi> have more large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deliver'd in setting forth the duty of man towards man, and not toward God and man both; yet however) <q>it gives the publick stamp and value to piety and devotion towards God, forasmuch as without conspicuous regard to this Rule in our intercourse with men, the most glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious pretences of piety towards God signifie nothing ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with God or men. To be wonderfully devout in a peculiar form or mode of worship, without honesty and ingenuity in our dealings with men, will be lookt upon as the hypocritical acting of a part, or at best as being bigot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to a certain mode, without any true notion or sense of Religion. In a word, to make the most glorious profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, and to espouse the precisest Sect and Party, without an equal regard to this, will at least be looked upon as an effect of pride and singularity, and be more than suspected as a cloak for knavery, (<hi>pag.</hi> 77.) For of all Religions in the World, Christianity is that of all other, which he can make the least pretence to— Which an Heathen, but ingenious observer of the genius of the Christian Religion, gives this account of: <hi>Nil nisi justum suadet &amp; &amp; lene,</hi> pag. 78.</q> [Wherein he confesseth, that the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of it is to stir up to <hi>Justice and Mildness,</hi> not to Wrong and Violence.]</p>
            <p>If this be too little, take that which follows (at no great distance, <hi>pag.</hi> 80, 81.) to supply the defect. Which is this: <q>Certainly there is nothing like down-right honesty, to give reputation to Religion; insomuch, that it is not only the most popular Argument to recommend it by, but is able

            <p>You perceive Sir! I hope, (if not, your skil in Morals, or Opticks, if you will, is small and it is but lost labor to send you any more Eye-salve,) how much you have erred and strayed from that <hi>golden Rule which forbids you to do that to another which you would not suffer from him,</hi> in laying to my charge things which I never knew nor thought of, while you your self would not hear from me things which the World, you know, knows of. Take heed for the future of departing from it. <hi>Being short,</hi> it is easily remembred; <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing plain</hi> it is soon understood; <hi>being just</hi> and equitable why should it not be observ'd?</p>
            <p>But I may not talk longer with you of these matters.</p>
            <p>In the last place, (for it happens in scanning your <hi>Bill</hi> as in reading an <hi>Anatomy Lecture</hi> on a dead Corps, where the Body begins to smell before the head has been sufficiently discourst of;) if you could not hinder the common Enemy of Mankind from <hi>putting it into your heart,</hi> (or if without his help, you were bad enough of your self) to imagine that I maliciously devised and intended to bring into hatred and
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:37307:35"/> contempt not only the <hi>Government and Governors of the Church of England, but the Government and Governors of the State and Commonwealth,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>likewise,</hi> as you farther calumniate: why should you suffer such <hi>vain thoughts</hi> (as the Scripture some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times calls as bad as bad may be,) <hi>to lodge within you,</hi> and not wash your heart as clean of them, as the <hi>Pharisees</hi> of old washed their hands before they thought it lawful to eat? Know you not that <hi>the thought of foolishness is sin</hi> (Prov. 24.9.) which needs to be <hi>forgiven</hi> (Acts 8.22.) and from which (being, as it is, a Branch of that Filthiness of the Spirit which is spoken of 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.1.) you must be <hi>purged,</hi> before <hi>holiness in the fear of the Lord can be perfected?</hi> Have you need to be taught that some of those <hi>secret faults</hi> which the Prophet prayed to be cleansed from (<hi>Psal.</hi> 19.12.) are evil thoughts? That by them, as well as by wicked words and deeds, <hi>a man is defiled?</hi> Matt. 15.19, 20. that they ought to be <hi>hated</hi> (Psal. 119.113.) expell'd and cast out of the heart? Must not be nourished, cherished and consen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to, if you mean to be <hi>saved?</hi> Jer. 4.14. If you know these things, I cannot imagine wherefore you should think <hi>I maliciously devised and intended to do what your Bill speaks of,</hi> in the place last mention'd, if it was not for want of <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity</hi> which <hi>thinketh no evil</hi> (without sufficient ground to su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect it,) 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.5. But here, I am sure there is none, and I make no question but that you thought and think so too. Which if you did and do, what <hi>Apology</hi> can be made or found for your hateful Hypocrisie in thinking one thing and say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing another in so grand and weighty a Case? To have thought and not said it had been bad enough, being contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to Charity, which is not <hi>light of belief,</hi> or apt, without good reason to be suspitious; but to say and not think it is worse, being a Sin of Wilfulness, whereas wrong Suspition hath somewhat of weakness to excuse it a little.</p>
            <p>Whatever some think (how can I tell that you are not one of that number?) You have seen that thoughts are no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing so <hi>free</hi> as they take them to be. The searcher of all hearts, <hi>from whom no secret can be hid.</hi> will severely judge those who judge not themselves for thinking amiss. Let me next shew (having no reason to think you will otherwise consider and apply it to the case in hand,) that words, (espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:37307:36"/> such groundless, causeless, malicious, scandalous and slanderous words as I find in your <hi>Bill,</hi>) are somewhat more than <hi>Wind,</hi> whatever they commonly say, or how favoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble soever you may be to those, because your own.</p>
            <p>Here you have given me occasion to ask you farther whether <hi>your Tongue is your own,</hi> to speak what you please and of whom you list, especially of one who so little, so not at all deserves it? Is no body <hi>Lord over you</hi> by whom, <hi>no Law above you,</hi> by which you may be called to account for this lawless Liberty of accusing the Innocent? Should you never be question'd for it while you live, did you never hear of a Time when <hi>hard Speeches</hi> shall as surely be judg'd and sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenc'd as <hi>ungodly deeds?</hi> (Jude 15.) and when <hi>idle words</hi> shall no less be accounted for than <hi>evil works?</hi> (as the Judge himself hath told you) <hi>Matt.</hi> 12.36. Where the <hi>idle word</hi> spoken of being interpreted by that Branch of <hi>Hyperbole</hi> which sometimes expresseth a thing in lefs (as at other times in greater) words than the matter strictly requires, [as hath once already, on another occasion, been noted, and is useful, if not needful to be farther observed in this place. So the vilest Sinners are called but <hi>vain People</hi> or <hi>idle Fellows.</hi> Psal. 26.4. Judg. 9.4. and the greatest sins (as Perjury and Idolatry) but <hi>vanity.</hi> Exod. 20.7.

Verses of the sams Chapter,] it will signifie such hateful and, at least, designedly hurtful Speech as you have used in your <hi>Bill.</hi> If you take it in the common sense, as <hi>Jerom (ad loc.)</hi> who expounds it to be <hi>Verbum quod nequaquam aedificat audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entes,</hi> an unedifying word; such as betters not the hearers of it in a spiritual manner: Or as <hi>Gregory the great,</hi> as they call him, somewhat more mildly resolves<note n="*" place="margin">Apud. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quin. ad loc.</note> it to be, <hi>Verbum quod sine loquentis utilitate dicitur &amp; audientis,</hi> A word which neither profits the Speaker nor Hearer of it; (under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing it thus, I say,) it makes not your Case the better but worse. For if <hi>idle, frivolous, fruitless words</hi> (which, if they do no good, do no hurt however, in the sense now
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:37307:36"/> spoken of,) are sufficient to provoke the displeasure of a righteous Judge, how much more will such dangerous ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumnies as your <hi>Bill</hi> consisteth of, incense him?</p>
            <p>To speak but this once more, on this occasion: To talk much and do little, to object a great deal and prove nothing (like the Pharisees, whom Christ in this place had to do with, <hi>v.</hi> 24.) is unquestionably included in the sense of <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>) should be <hi>verbum ineffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cax vel effectu carens</hi>) therefore called <hi>idle,</hi> because it was <hi>vain and ineffectual</hi> to the purpose which the Pharisees intended it for? Which was, to perswade the multitude, that He act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Devil's assistance <hi>in casting out Devils,</hi> and not by the Spirit of God, <hi>v.</hi> 24. This they said, but could not prove, and therefore talked <hi>idly.</hi> And because the people were so far from believing what they objected, that on the contrary they magnified the power of God by which that and the rest of his Miracles were wrought, therefore the word which his enemies had spoken, was <hi>idle.</hi> Now saith Christ, in effect, to those cursed Objecters, Tho' the word which you have spoken against me, is but <hi>vain, idle and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>effectual talk</hi> (sufficiently malicious indeed, but not mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievous enough to make the multitude think as ill of me as your wicked design was to perswade them,) yet I say unto you, <hi>That every such idle word which men shall speak, they shall give account thereof in the day of Judgment.</hi> Tho' your words have done me no such hurt as you purposed, yet you must not think you are guilty of no sin in speaking them: but because your design was ill, and the naughtiness of your hearts hath been discover'd by the nature of your words (which are not the less blasphemous for being <hi>idle,</hi> v. 31.) you shall surely be accountable for them.</p>
            <p>May not I likewise say to you, Tho' your words are <hi>vain and idle,</hi> (the <hi>Book</hi> which you accuse me for, being able to confute them,) yet because they were written with a wicked design of making the World believe that I was guilty of what I never as much as thought of: be sure you shall <hi>render an account of them in the day of Judgment?</hi> This, perhaps, some of you dread not much, but would think your selves
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:37307:37"/> pretty safe (like I know not who, that desir'd to be try'd by the twelve Apostles, <hi>till whose coming,</hi> because he was told it would be long first, he said <hi>he could tarry well enough,</hi>) should you never be brought to another reckoning. But if you know not the penalty of <hi>promoting a false suggestion</hi> which you cannot make good by sufficient proof, there are in <hi>England</hi> who can teach you, tho' 'tis now too late to learn it <hi>gratis,</hi> as in time you might have done: <hi>vid.</hi> 38 <hi>Edw.</hi> 3.9. You resolved, it seems, to cast at least a Cart-load of Dung upon a <hi>Frog</hi> for hopping too near you; But your wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom had been shewn in considering before-hand how much more noysom the smell was like to prove, than the <hi>little Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal</hi> could be troublesom.</p>
            <p>That dangerous <hi>Book</hi> which you helped to give the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor an occasion of composing (and has partly been the cause of all this farther talk) you say <hi>that I published and dispersed,</hi> whereas divers people that sought far and near for it, had never seen it to this day, had not you your selves (by promises never worthy in my opinion to be trusted, had they otherwise deserved regard,) gotten several Copies into your hands without my knowledge or allowance, and then helped such as you thought would be irritated to do me a mischief, if they could, to the sight and perusal of it.</p>
            <p>Now you have it, be pleas'd to take the pain of looking on the 53 Page of the <hi>Special Account,</hi> &amp;c. which tells you of an angry man who objected against <hi>a Book of St.</hi> Jerom<hi>'s (de Virgin. conserv.)</hi> that in it he had aspersed every Order, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree and Profession of Christian People; in a word, the whole Church all the World over (if that is the English of <hi>Ʋniversa Ecclesia,</hi>) in the filthiest manner he could; tho' <hi>Sulpitius Severus</hi> (a better Judge than <hi>Ruffinus</hi>) confessed he had spoken but truth, and St. <hi>Jerom</hi> himself after thirty Years space saw no cause to repent his writing it. Just ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther such Accusation <hi>(as like it as one Egg or Fig is like another,)</hi> is this which you bring against me; and as much reason after so many Years past, (could I hope to live so long) I should have to repent of what I have written. I dare say (unless you love Mony as much as your <hi>brother-Doctor,</hi> never before prais'd, nor ever like to be, for ought I can see, as deeply concern'd in the Contents of it as he is,) you would glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

            <p>Know you not, Sir! whose work it is <hi>to accuse the Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren?</hi> and wherefore he is called <hi>their Accuser?</hi> Rev. 12.10. Is it fit for you to be like him, and worse? For they are not <hi>his</hi> Brethren whom he accuseth: But if the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> is your <hi>Mother,</hi> you have clearly been guilty of <hi>sitting and speaking against your Brother, and slandering your own Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's Son,</hi> like that wilful sinner, <hi>Psal.</hi> 50.20. who is therefore forbidden <hi>to preach God's Laws, declare his Statutes, or speak of his Covenants,</hi> Ver. 16. Have not you likewise <hi>given your mouth to evil,</hi> as he did? and hath not your tongue <hi>framed deceit,</hi> like his? <hi>Ver.</hi> 19.

But the man's mind was so intent on the Vindication of what he had undertaken, to justifie, that he forgot his Grammar-Rules. Were not you likewise, when this <hi>wretchedly-wicked-Bill</hi> was drawn, so bent to render me odious (had it been in your power) by as <hi>base, unchristian, ungodly, unpriestly an Accusation</hi> as you could, (Did you think that this would diminish and not increase your hateful hypocrisie, too far discover'd before?) that you never minded how it could be proved; as if your bare word had been enough to make the innocent guilty. What! have you ever a little <hi>ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Levite, Knight</hi> or <hi>Priest of the Post</hi> more at hand? Or on what else was your hope fixed? <hi>The Naked Truth</hi> I know you are no friend to.</note>; And did I not stand <hi>at their Elbows,</hi> while those rare Pieces were writing, and dictate the worst part especially to them; being then but five or seven Years old, or thereabout?</p>
            <p>This you may say as truly, as, <hi>that I devis'd and design'd to bring into hatred and contempt the Government and Governors of the State and Common-wealth of this Kingdom,</hi> when there was not the least occasion in my way to write of either.</p>

            <p>These things consider'd, I shall not wonder hereafter, that <hi>Virgilius,</hi> a <hi>German</hi> Bishop, was thought and pronounced guilty of Heresie, for holding the terrestrial Globe to be inhabited by <hi>Antipodes,</hi> or that <hi>Roger Bacon,</hi> that learned Fryer, was mistaken for a Conjurer by such as were <hi>no well-wishers to the Mathematicks:</hi> nor that <hi>C.

How can <hi>ill-will speak well?</hi> or who can hope that so restless a spirit as that of <hi>revenge</hi> is, should be quiet?

Their wrath and rage is <hi>too great,</hi> their wisdom and goodness <hi>too little</hi> to keep <hi>Vengeance</hi> within due bounds, should the liberty of avenging themselves be granted them. You will say, that <hi>it is not Revenge, but Justice,</hi> to prosecute Offenders by due course of Law. Which I grant.

            <p n="1">1. <q>That he who resolves to use all advantage of human Laws, which in such matters against his brother he can take, might as well forswear the Gospel, as a famous man (whose words I beseech you to read again and again, before you presume to dissent) hath deliver'd his judgment<note n="*" place="margin">Dr. <hi>Jack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi> of Justif.

                  </note>.</q> The matters which he speaks of are indeed somewhat different from this; but not so unlike as can hinder his words from being applied to both cases.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That nothing but the Spirit of <hi>Revenge</hi> could move you to object what you cannot prove against me, whom you know to be no less a friend to the Christian Religion, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> than the <hi>best</hi> of you all, (and more than the <hi>most</hi> of you,)
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:37307:38"/> as well as you know the difference between a <hi>Bill</hi> which you cannot justifie, and a <hi>Book</hi> which you dare not undertake to answer. For who hath most reason to be judged the best friend to any Cause? he that hath gained much or nothing at all by faithful adherence to it? And what but this evil Spirit of <hi>Revenge</hi> hath made you <hi>breath out such a company of threatnings</hi> as again and again I am told of, like that <hi>young Pharisee</hi> (Acts 9.1.) whose example one would think you should now be <hi>too old</hi> and <hi>too wise</hi> to follow? I wish you no more hurt however than that you may prove <hi>as good Saints</hi> as he afterwards became and continued to his dying day.

            <p>Divers distracted People I have seen in <hi>Bedlam</hi> and else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, whose looks were never more <hi>wild,</hi> nor their words more <hi>odd and senseless</hi> than his at that time were.

            <p>
               <hi>Quae quibus anteferam?</hi> What shall I now set down first of those many things which his ill Behavior, his Rage, Wrath, Malice, and <hi>more than short madnesi</hi> hath given me cause to write? Whether he was purposely sent, or came of his own accord, to <hi>urge me as vehemently</hi> and provoke me as rudely as he could, laying wait for me and seeking to <hi>catch something out of my mouth that he might accuse me,</hi> (like those captious Opponents, <hi>Luke</hi> 11.53, 54.) I cannot tell: However it was, That I might not <hi>by answering a Fool accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his folly,</hi> be like him; (<hi>Prov.</hi> 26.4.) or by casting Stones at a Dog for barking, (as Children use to do,) make him twice more troublesome than before: And because there's a better way to tame and hamper an Ass that kicks, than by <hi>recalcitration;</hi> shortly, because <hi>it is better to suffer than offer wrong;</hi> and he that is second in such kind of talk is as bad at least as the beginner, if not worse: On these Principles I gave him not as bad as he brought, nor <hi>rendred evil for evil, or railing for railing</hi> (1 Pet. 3.9.) as easie as it was to retaliate, (a more obnoxious Adversary being hard to be found;) but chose rather to follow the best and grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test Example of Meekness that ever was or will be heard of, <hi>who when he was reviled, reviled not again,</hi> 1 Pet. 2.23.</p>
            <p>The contrary course (that of giving two, or if it be possible, ten words of this kind, for one,) is esteemed cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragious. As great <hi>madness</hi> as it is, there are who think it

And who can imagin that one of his worthy Successors neglected to answer that blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemous, black-mouth'd Fellow (whom the <hi>King of Assyria</hi> sent to <hi>tire</hi> his patience and not to <hi>try</hi> it only) for lack of matter or words, or for fear of incurring his farther displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, and not to avoid the giving him an occasion of blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheming the more? 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 18.36.</p>
            <p>Had I judg'd it lawful to treat him in his own Languge, yet it seemed not expedient for a double reason, which a wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser man than I believe he loves to be familiar with, hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven his Reader. <hi>Ecclus.</hi> 8.3, 11. <hi>Fire is not quench'd but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creased by laying on more Fuel;</hi> and it is not culpable but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable <hi>to cut off occasion from those who desire occasion</hi> of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing harm, or being mischievous. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.12. When malice, which knows too well how to work deceitfully, would <hi>undermine</hi> by contumely, it is but prudence to <hi>coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine</hi> it by silence. <hi>There is one,</hi> saith the Wiseman before prais'd (<hi>Ecclus.</hi> 20.5, 6, 7.) <hi>that keepeth silence and is found wise: And another by much babling becometh hateful. Some man holdeth his Tongue because he hath not to answer; and some keepeth silence knowing his time. A Wiseman will hold his Tongue till he seeth opportunity: But a Babler and a Fool will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard no time.</hi> A wiser than he told us, There's <hi>a Time to keep silence as well as a Time to speak;</hi> (Eccles. 3.7. where his<note n="*" place="margin">Which I will not arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate to my self, tho' I know not from whence I had it.</note> observation, whoever first made it, That a time of <hi>silence</hi> goes before that of <hi>speaking;</hi> with <hi>Jerom</hi>'s short infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, <hi>Discamus itaque— prius non loqui, ut postea ad loquen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum ora reseremus,</hi> Let us first learn <hi>not to speak</hi> that silence may teach us how to speak, is worth the remembring.) In another Scripture we read of <hi>an evil time wherein the pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:37307:41"/> shall keep silence; (Vid.</hi> Amos 5.13.) And experience teacheth that in the matter of reprehension (which few care to meddle with, and many, if not the most spoil in handling,) the Circumstance of <hi>Time</hi> as well as of <hi>Place</hi> is greatly to be heeded. For who that understands himself will or can think a reproof well bestow'd and not cast away on a drunken Beast <hi>when he reels,</hi> or a proud, passionate fool <hi>while he rails?</hi> In that <hi>evil time, the prudent without question, will hold their</hi> Peace, and wait for a better opportunity, like that <hi>rich Churl</hi>'s discreet Wife (no less commended for her good understanding than her beautiful Countenance, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 25.3.) whose sottish foolish Husband was so shamefully overflown with Wine and overcome with passion, that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead of relieving <hi>David</hi> and his Men, <hi>he railed on them</hi> in as ill and unworthy a manner as a hot-headed-fool could do. <hi>Ver.</hi> 10, 14, 15, 16: Yet the good Woman said nothing to him, less or more <hi>till the morning light appeared—ver.</hi> 36. It had been but lost labor to tell him of his danger <hi>till his drunken fit was over:</hi> But as soon the Wine was gone out (<hi>v.</hi> 37.) and the Sot was come again to himself, she took him to task and made him so sensible of his Folly that the cowardly, covetous Fool neither knew what to do or say, but <hi>suffered his Heart to sink into his Heels.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The proud is <hi>as he that transgresseth by wine, (Vid.</hi> Habak. 2.5.) is as prone to quarrel and contend, as apt to rail and revile as the veriest Sot that ever opened his mouth to take in more drink than his Belly could hold, or his Brains master. I say therefore, let what will be the Cause of rail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; Pride or Drink, Wine or Wrath stirred up by Pride, the Case is the same to a <hi>wise Reprover.</hi> While passion swag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers and bears sway, rants and rages like a tameless Panther or masterless Tyger, reason can no more be heard <hi>than the humming of a Bee in Clap of Thunder.</hi> He must therefore ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>journ his Work to some other time, who intends not to lose his Labor.</p>
            <p>It is much more charitable to believe that the <hi>Scum</hi> of the Pot which boiled so fast some Months since, is pretty well wasted by this time (I wish there were reason to hope it hath put out the Fire; to believe it hath done so, is more charitable, I say) than to seek out the Truth of it is easie:
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:37307:41"/> Supposing however, because I cannot be sure it is so, that this <hi>little soon-heated Pot</hi> is grown cooler and made cleaner than of late it was; let me venture to draw near and touch it without danger of scalding or fouling my Fingers, if I can. If I err and am deceived in thinking better than the business will bear, let me find you favourable in granting me this one request who am not like to trouble you with another.</p>

            <p>That <hi>a despicable Adversary,</hi> who himself is exposed to more exceptions than a Friend <hi>can,</hi> or an Enemy <hi>will</hi> hide, should insult; is his own, and not another's shame.

            <p>The <hi>Truths</hi> to be told him are these:</p>
            <p n="1">1. That not to have much Wealth, but <hi>to get and use it well</hi> is praise-worthy. <hi>Omnia quae extra nos bona sunt—non ideo laudantur quod habuerit quis ea, sed quod iis honeste sit usus. Nam divitiae &amp; potentia &amp; gratia cum plurimum virium dent in utram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que partem, certissimum faciunt morum experimentum: Aut enim meliores propter haec aut pejores sumus.

            <p n="2">2. That <hi>Gold is a thing which every Fool is taken with,</hi> if <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racides</hi> erred not. <hi>Ecclus.</hi> 31.7.</p>
            <p n="3">3. That <hi>a sound Body is as good as all Riches,</hi> Ecclus. 30.16. much better is <hi>mens sana in corpore sano,</hi> a sound mind which rules and governs such a Body.</p>
            <p n="4">4. That he who <hi>lays up Treasure</hi> for himself <hi>(on Earth)</hi> and is not <hi>rich towards God,</hi> is but ill provided for, <hi>Luke</hi> 12.21.</p>
            <p n="5">5. That worldly Wealth is none of the <hi>best Substance.</hi> We read of better, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.34.</p>
            <p n="6">6. That as none of the <hi>Caesars</hi> (if <hi>Vespasian</hi> was not) were the better for being <hi>Emperors;</hi> so if <hi>one</hi> is the better for growing rich, more than <hi>ten</hi> to one are the worse. For di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers pretended reasons which<note n="*" place="margin">Tom. <hi>5.</hi> Hom. <hi>30.</hi> Quod nemo laeditur nisi à semet ipso.</note>
               <hi>Chrysostom</hi> discourseth of, <hi>Riches</hi> are generally said to be desir'd. For divers <hi>purposes</hi> which cannot be had or attain'd without them they are ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable. For the sake of one's Countrey, Kindred, Friends, Acquaintance, Strangers and all (to whom they may ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:37307:45"/> us useful and helpful) they are also desirable. This is the commonly pretended opinion which prevails <hi>both by Sea and Land,</hi> and is every where extold to the Skies. But I know, saith he, that it rather deserves to be called a <hi>flame</hi> than an <hi>opinion:</hi> A Flame <hi>which sets the whole World on fire,</hi> while no body labors to quench, but every one rather strives to increase it, by bringing more and more <hi>Fuel,</hi> day after day, to the <hi>Fire.</hi> For the Rich, who have most of the World, as earnestly desire more, as if they had <hi>nothing;</hi> the Poor are daily striving (and raging like People stark mad) to get as much Wealth as the Rich are possest of: and in all places, among all People the love of mony is so prevalent, that <hi>Friendship</hi> is trodden under Foot, the <hi>Bonds</hi> of Nature it self are broken, the greatest and nearest <hi>Kindred</hi> is despised, forsaken and forgotten for the sake of it. Like a wild, untamed <hi>Beast</hi> it rageth. Like a cruel imperious <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stress,</hi> it possesseth all hearts. No <hi>Barbarian</hi> is fiercer, no <hi>Tyrant</hi> crueller, nor any <hi>Whore</hi> more impudent. Every where it shews how void of Mercy and Pity, how rigid, terrible, turbulent, boisterous, impious and truculent it is. And tho' Bears, Lyons and Wolves are not <hi>savager,</hi> yet no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing seems <hi>sweeter.</hi> As many Swords, Snares, Pits, Preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pices, Rocks, Shipwracks and other dangers as it exposeth them to, they imbrace it not the less. For they love, <hi>like Swine, to wallow in Mire,</hi> and as Beetles and other filthy Flies, are much delighted in Dunghils; <hi>which the worse they smell the more they love.</hi> Thus, and otherwise more at large, he shews the <hi>reasons</hi> before-mention'd (by which the most would justifie their desire of Riches,) to be but <hi>pretended.</hi> After which he proceeds to discover the <hi>true Causes</hi> why the generality of People would be wealthy. And wherefore is it, but that the <hi>purposes</hi> of Pride, Luxury, Delicacy and Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luptuousness (which would otherwise fall to the ground and perish) may be served? And why do the Fingers of most Folk itch to be treasuring up Mony and Goods as fast as they can, but that they may be <hi>serv'd and honor'd,</hi> (ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mir'd and almost ador'd,) <hi>and in hope of being fear'd by look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing big and formidable to their Enemies, and by having Power at Will to be avenged of such as dare oppose them tho' never so justly?</hi> Setting aside these true and real reasons, there are <hi>not many,
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:37307:46"/> if any better,</hi> which can be given for that insatiable Thirst of growing rich which the most are subject to. For Riches make no man the <hi>wiser or soberer,</hi> the <hi>more meek or merciful,</hi> the <hi>more placid, gentle, continent, modest, virtuous or less vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luptuous than he was without them;</hi> but on the contrary are of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten seen <hi>to dispossess many good and commendable Qualities, that worse may take place.</hi> For what but <hi>Luxury, Fury, Wrath, Rage, Intemperance, Arrogance, Injustice, Pride and all bruitish Affections are the common Companions of Wealth? But these are reasons why it should not be desir'd, and not why it should,</hi> as after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward he shews. That most are the worse and but few the better for it, hath been so often exemplified in all Ages, as makes it a plainer Truth than is fit to be wished it were.</p>
            <p n="7">7. That the richer a man is, <hi>the greater temptations</hi> he hath to grapple with, <hi>the more Enemies</hi> to encounter, <hi>the more sins and snares</hi> to beware of, <hi>the more thorns</hi> to take heed of that they hurt not his hands, feet, face, or whole body and soul too. For the cares, riches and pleasures of this mortal life are compared to <hi>Thorns;</hi> (Luke 8.7, 14.) whence <hi>a better Homilist</hi> than a hundred of 'em hath admonisht the rich to take heed of handling these Thorns to their hurt, as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly they do. For who, in times of peace are as <hi>proud, imperious, supercilious and voluptuous</hi> as they? who more for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getful of God? more apt to despise and oppress the poor, at such a time? When persecution ariseth who <hi>more timorous?</hi> or in greater danger of <hi>denying the Truth</hi> for fear of losing their Wealth? When their care of getting more is past, if ever it be while they live, their fear of sustaining the loss of what they have gotten, never leaves them. <hi>O praeclara opum mortalium beatitudo, quam cum adeptus fueris, securus esse desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>isti!</hi> Boeth. de cons.

Either of the two alone is hard to be born; but when both meet together the Burthen seems intolerable. Yet to make it heavier divers other Considerations concurr'd. <hi>What the Eye never sees the Heart never rues.</hi> But he saw <hi>the rich man's Plenty,</hi> beheld <hi>the Fulness of his Tables, the frequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of his Guests,</hi> and <hi>the Multitude of his Waiters, with his ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous Wines, numerous Cooks, Troops of Parasites, Sets and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sorts of Musick,</hi> or <hi>whatever preparation can be made for Lux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ury.</hi> All this he beheld <hi>while he himself was pained with Sores, pinch'd and pin'd with Hunger, without a Crumb of Bread or Drop of Comfort administred to relieve him, tho' his weakness was such as disabled him to drive away the Dogs which licked his ulce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Legs</hi>

            <p n="1">1. Let him take heed of <hi>swallowing down Riches which must</hi> be <hi>vomited up again,</hi> Job 20.15, 18.</p>
            <p n="2">2. If they wrong him not, who report him to be rich, let him beware of believing, that he shall not give account for his manner of <hi>using</hi> as well as of <hi>getting</hi> Wealth, <hi>Luke</hi> 16.2.

            <p n="4">4. Be his Wealth more or less, let him beware of think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that the better sort of People (who have commonly more <hi>Vertue</hi> than <hi>Mony,</hi>) will weigh him by the <hi>pound,</hi> or measure him by the <hi>acre.</hi> For if this were <hi>just weight and mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,</hi> how many vain people would take themselves to be more worth than that excellent Man, who was not asham'd to say, <hi>silver and gold have I none?</hi> Acts 3.6.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Should he live long enough and find ways enough to <hi>lay up gold as dust,</hi> (which is plentiful enough in some Months of the Year,) <hi>and fine gold as the stones of the brooks,</hi> (which are not very hard to come at) <hi>Job</hi> 22.24. if he would not be deceived, let him not believe that nothing is more valuable or desirable, more precious or profitable

            <p n="6">6. Could he really turn all that he toucheth into Gold, as is fabled of <hi>Midas;</hi> let him never be perswaded how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever that all the Pieces and Wedges, Tuns and Mines of Gold in the World, are sufficient to make such a <hi>golden Age</hi> as the Poets talk of.

            <p n="7">7. Were he owner of as much Gold and Silver as King <hi>David</hi> prepared for the House of the Lord, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 22.14. (an incredible Sum, unless Talents be there taken for pieces, and those but small ones;) let him never believe, however, but that <hi>Gold may be bought too dear,</hi> Matth. 16.26.</p>
            <p n="8">8. If nothing of all this will restrain him from <hi>making Gold his hope, and from saying to fine gold, Thou art my confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,</hi> (Job 31.24.) let him then beware, lest <hi>his Mony pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish with him;</hi> if not rather conclude that needs it must. And once for all, to take leave (unless his more than ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary dulness must have more spurring or lashing,) let this <hi>single direction</hi> be given him: If his Wealth is so great, and his Wit, or Grace, or both, so little, that he knows not how to bestow it better, than in making provision for <hi>Pride, Arrogance, Self-conceit and Confidence;</hi> let him take his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample who built <hi>a Hospital for Fools,</hi> with the Mony which his silly Clients had made him Master of: <hi>Of Fools he said he had gotten it, and to Fools he resolved to leave it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What use he will make of this Example, is more than I can tell: but if still (after all the pain that hath now been taken to make him wiser,) his <hi>Pride is incorrigible,</hi> and his <hi>Arrogance incurable,</hi> as well as intolerable; Who can deny, that his Title to a Place in such an <hi>Hospital</hi> is too clear to be disputed?</p>
            <p>How much better was your other Instrument, That <hi>Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nium horarum homo?</hi> unless you chuse rather to call him <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>photerus, Hecaterus,</hi> or <hi>Ʋdeterus;</hi> he that can be <hi>Pro</hi> and <hi>Con</hi>

            <p>The wild <hi>Boars</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> and the <hi>Foxes</hi> of <hi>Geneva,</hi> were then his <hi>Metaphors:</hi> the <hi>Church of England</hi> the <hi>Vineyard,</hi> for which he seemed hugely concern'd, lest the <hi>Boar of the Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest</hi> should break forth and waste it, or the <hi>Beast of the field</hi> devour it, <hi>Ps.</hi> 80.13.

            <p n="5">5. That <hi>all who refused by this gentler Discipline to be reform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ought to be prosecuted as Recusants, according to the Statute made in the third Year of K.</hi> James; and if this was too little, it seemed (to this profound Politician, and as great Statist as Conscientious Man) needful <hi>that the more incorrigible should be proceeded against, as is directed in the Penal Statute of the</hi> 35th <hi>of Q.</hi> Elizabeth. <hi>Any Statute,</hi> tho' made against <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish Recusants</hi> only, <hi>was at that time as good</hi> (in this <hi>Hic &amp; Ʋbique</hi>'s opinion) <hi>against other Dissenters from the Church of England, as</hi> the best Hay in <hi>Crediton.</hi>

            <p>Here, at last, he begins to prophecy. But the Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of false Prophets hath often, if not alway been greater than that of the true. Time was when 450 of <hi>Baal</hi>'s could sooner be found than one <hi>Elias,</hi> 1 Kings 18.</p>
            <p>It was not my purpose to give the Reader a view of his late Worship's late thoughts (whatever his present Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are,) in a <hi>double dozen</hi> of Articles; but to this num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber they casually grew, in reading the Papers out of which they were extracted. Now, the Premisses consider'd, Was not this <hi>a Church-of-England-man all over?</hi> from top to toe? and as <hi>over-grown</hi> a Conformist as any of 'em all? <hi>A true Son of the Church,</hi> no doubt, he then seemed to be.

If any hath need to be inform'd, let him only remember how little while since (no longer ago than <hi>July</hi> the 9th. or 10th. 88.) he charged <hi>some who make a great figure</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">The Bishops, no doubt, who were sent to the Tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er: Those if he meant, (as whom else could he?) both great and small who ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>her'd to them, must come in for a part of the Charge.</note> (in the Church of <hi>England</hi>) with <hi>refractory Carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age and feigned Zeal:</hi> whom he likewise, at the same time, in the next part of his Talkment, pronounced <hi>guilty of contradicting their own Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin in point of obedience to their Superiors, while they censure other Churches for absurdity in their Doctrines.</hi> [Transubstantiation it self, it seems, in this <hi>Timist</hi>'s opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, was not a greater sign of absurdity, than <hi>humbly to desire that the Declaration might not be imposed on the Clergy to be read in their respective Churches,</hi> was a token of disobedience to Superiors.] Next he represented them as <hi>a People possest with Passion and Folly, by which the Peace of the Kingdom and the Honour of our Religion greatly suffer:</hi> [Is this less than to call them <hi>Disturbers</hi> of the Peace, and <hi>Disgracers</hi> of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on?] And as if it sufficed to say,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But now it is modest to banter the one, and baffle the other,</hi> by those few words, of I know not what <hi>Ballad,</hi> dropt into the ears of his Auditors, went about to perswade them, that his lately extoll'd <hi>Church-of-England-men</hi> were <hi>departed from their Principles of honoring the King for Conscience-sake, and of hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Person sacred.</hi>

            <p>In the same <hi>Harangue</hi> he accused them of being no less than fill'd with <hi>disloyal and undutiful apprehensions of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jestie's Government, and of cruel Rudeness, cover'd with a pretence of Zeal—</hi>

            <p>Anatomists are sometimes forced to dissect and read on those parts of the <hi>Carkass</hi> before them, first of all, which are apt to putrifie soonest; lest their noysom smell should grow too offensive to be indur'd, while the dryer and solider substance of the body is discours'd of. But this man's talk is so full of <hi>filth and ordure, guts and garbage,</hi> (fit for none but <hi>Bears and such foul-feeding Beasts</hi> to live on, or tast of,) that it will not seem strange to those who can smell, to see me draw back <hi>like a Bear from the stake,</hi> to get out of that <hi>pesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Air</hi> which is commonly caused when this Man's mouth is opened. Yet, before I part, tho' I stop my breath or hold my nose while I pen it, something must needs be added about those <hi>little Holders-forth</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">It is no rid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle to tell whom he cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led so, in his Speech of <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> 9th or 10th —88.</note> who (to use his very terms<note n="†" place="margin">Ibid.</note>) <hi>make it their business to explain hard words</hi> (not far hence to be mention'd) <hi>by unintelligible notions—</hi> Which, in my ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehension, is as wonderful a way of <hi>Explication</hi> as ever was heard of, and as hard an <hi>Operation</hi> as it is to <hi>inlighten with darkness, fatten with leanness, make sober with drunkenness, sound of mind with madness, or healthy with sickness:</hi> as difficult a task as <hi>to inrich with poverty, make famous with obscurity, sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere with hypocrisie, or honest with knavery.</hi> Which if any man can do, he needs not despair of proving, that <hi>an old Rump-Committee-man and an honest man, an Ape, Ass, Fox, Wolf or any other Animal and a Bear, are but one and the same creature, explain'd by different names.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>These <hi>little Holders-forth</hi> are certainly men of great worth and as rare fellows as ever were heard of; as able as any men living to make hard words <hi>soft as Adamant, malleable as Glass, perceptible as Colours to the blind,</hi> or <hi>Musick to the deaf?</hi> In a word, <hi>as bright and clear as the palpable darkness of</hi> Egypt.</p>
            <p>O the rare, unsearchable, unintelligible Power of these <hi>little Holders-forth!</hi> The <hi>quadrature of the Circle,</hi> the inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the <hi>Philosopher's stone,</hi> the solution of the hardest
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:37307:52"/>
               <hi>Phaenomena</hi> which have hitherto been heard of, are but <hi>toys</hi> to what they can do. <hi>Aristotle's Problems</hi> are but <hi>Childrens Riddles, Euclid's Demonstrations</hi> but <hi>School-boy-tricks</hi> and <hi>trifles,</hi> to their vast, incomprehensible Abilities. Who would not wish <hi>they might never do any thing else but hold forth?</hi> And if <hi>little Holders-forth</hi> are able to do all this, what Sentence is or can be so <hi>hard-worded,</hi> what Word so <hi>hard-syllabl'd,</hi> what Syllable so <hi>hard-letter'd</hi> or harsh-sounded, which will not <hi>dissolve like a Flint, steep'd in the Powder of a rotten Post,</hi> when the Men who <hi>make a greater figure in the faculty of Holding-forth,</hi> take it into their mouths, and roll it up and down on their tongues? Let their <hi>Carriage in point of Obedience to their Superiors be as refractory</hi> as this false Accuser hath said, but not prov'd it to be, there is no word, for certain, so hard, which these <hi>greater Holders-forth</hi> cannot presently make <hi>as soft as this man's heart,</hi> when they take it in hand.</p>
            <p>It was wisely done however, (if it was not more by chance than choice) to confine the faculty of <hi>explaining hard words by unintelligible notions,</hi> within the modest bounds of but <hi>three or four such words</hi> and no more.</p>
            <p>The first of which he calls, <hi>Predestination;</hi> the next, <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation;</hi> the third <hi>Transubstantiation; (a wicked hard word indeed,</hi> made up of at least <hi>seven</hi> Syllables, consisting of <hi>a do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen and a half</hi> of Letters. Many Sentences are shorter, as well as softer.) and the last, <hi>Adoration.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>These are the words which <hi>this worthy Censor</hi> said (in the Speech last pointed at, but never prais'd) <hi>are used to fright the People out of their senses, and then bid them make use of their rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son. These,</hi> as he adds, <hi>are made the Subject of every Discourse,</hi> (being mightily pertinent, it seems, to all purposes;) and, as afterward he worded it, <hi>are explained by every little Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der-forth,</hi> and that too <hi>by unintelligible Notions, while the plain Doctrin of Obedience, Humility, and Charity, will by no means agree with the Constitutions of those over-grown-Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now that none of those <hi>Holders-forth,</hi> be they great or little, may be longer in his debt than becomes their ability or agrees with his necessity (who, they say, is a Borrower, tho' I never heard of any wise Man that gave him credit;) give me leave to repay him with <hi>an equal number of words,</hi>
               <pb n="104" facs="tcp:37307:53"/> but little softer if not altogether <hi>as hard</hi> as his own, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover his senses, and rub up his reason; both which, I plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly perceive, are in danger of deserting him. Mine are, <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varication, Retrogradation, Transfiguration, Adulation.</hi> Which because I am somewhat too busie at present <hi>to explain</hi> by <hi>unintelligible Notions,</hi> let him take this homelier explanation of them: (the more <hi>dunstable,</hi> the more suitable to his intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect, I take it to be. Thus then it is:) <hi>Prevarication,</hi> or Double-dealing; (will not this please him who hath shewn himself as great an enemy to <hi>Plain-dealing</hi> as any of you all?) <hi>Retrogradation,</hi> or going back from Principles for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly own'd and extoll'd; <hi>Transfiguration,</hi> or shifting of shapes; [like <hi>Proteus</hi> in the Poets,

And for farther illustration, if this suffice not, he may take the <hi>Polypus,</hi> (which can look like a <hi>Fish</hi> or a <hi>Stone,</hi> as he finds it most serviceable to save himself or catch his prey;) or <hi>Chamelion,</hi> who can turn it self, if <hi>Zoographers</hi> say true, into any colour but <hi>red</hi> (the token of <hi>modesty,</hi> as in blushing,) or <hi>white,</hi> the known badge of <hi>innocency.</hi> Which the least of those <hi>little Holders-forth</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore-mention'd can tell him how and to whom to apply, if he cannot or will not make as right application as he ought to make.] <hi>Adulation,</hi> or flattery; of which as none but a <hi>Fool</hi> can be ignorant, so none but a <hi>Knave</hi> will be guilty.</p>
            <p>Whether these or the other <hi>hard words have frighted more people out of their senses,</hi> I am too much in hast to determin: especially, being ignorant whether he meant <hi>their proper on common, their external or internal, their five or seven senses.</hi> What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:37307:53"/> becomes of that <hi>Question,</hi> it was cruelly, rigidly, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reasonably and unmercifully done of <hi>those hard words to bid people make use of their reason,</hi> when first they had <hi>frighted them out of their senses.</hi> This, in truth, makes them <hi>hard words</hi> with a witness. The most <hi>hard-dealing words</hi> that ever were heard of. There is not, I believe, in all the <hi>Welch Tongue</hi> or <hi>Cornish Dialect,</hi> another such <hi>Mess of hard words</hi> to be met with. What! To bid people exercise their <hi>reason,</hi> who have lost their <hi>memories</hi> and <hi>fancies,</hi> their faculty of <hi>seeing, hearing, tasting, smelling, feeling and all;</hi> Was ever the like seen or heard of? If there was, 'tis like the bidding them <hi>go, without legs,</hi> or <hi>speak, without tongues.</hi> It is pity, to deal plainly, that such <hi>hard Words</hi> are not banisht all Lexicons, Glossaries, and Nomenclators. And I wonder how <hi>those little Holders-forth can hold out</hi> to make them the <hi>Subject of every Discourse,</hi> or where they can find <hi>unintelligible Notions</hi> enough to explain them by, considering how many the <hi>Rosy-Crucians, Chymists, School-men, Quakers</hi> and other <hi>Canters</hi> have taken up before-hand for their own proper use, to make <hi>Divinity</hi> too, among other things, <hi>a greater Mystery than the twelve Apostles ever understood.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is able to stun a wiser Man than <hi>a Country-Justice,</hi> to be thus abused and frighted with <hi>hard Words.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And how sad a pass is the World come to when <hi>the plain Doctrin of Obedience, Humility and Charity, will by no means agree with the Constitutions of over-grown Protestants!</hi>

            <p>The <hi>Crocodile</hi> (that amphibious <hi>Animal,</hi> who can shift himself from water to dry ground, and from thence back again to his <hi>liquid lodging;</hi> being a friend to both Elements, and befriended by both: as some can be of either side which happens to be uppermost; or of any Principles which are most for their profit. This Animal, I say) is said <hi>to grow bigger and bigger</hi> as long as he lives, whereas other living-creatures are subject to certain limits of augmentation which they never exceed. Be that true or false, if Protestants grow not <hi>better and better,</hi> but worse and worse, not grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and greater, but less and less in <hi>Obedience, Humility</hi> and <hi>Charity,</hi> or any other Grace or Graces, they are not an <hi>over-grown,</hi> but <hi>under-grown, dwarfish, selfish sort of people;</hi> as like this <hi>idle and worse Talker,</hi> as one self-seeker can be like

            <p>Sir! Whatever you think, indifferent People are of the mind that the badness of the <hi>Tools</hi> with which you have wrought and labour'd as hard as you could to do me a mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief, is a sign of as hard a shift as ever poor People were dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to.

            <p>Your <hi>Scandalum Magnatum</hi> about which so much Breath hath been wasted in <hi>threatning</hi> and <hi>talking</hi> what wonders it would do, appears to be nothing but <hi>a scanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous pretence</hi> of a wrong never done.<note n="*" place="margin">For, at present to say nothing of a scruple, which to me and others, as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>skilful in Law-cases, may render it doubtful; suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing the man whom you placed in the front of <hi>your Bill</hi> (to make it look as big and terrible to silly People as was possible,) to be one of those <hi>hautes homes</hi> whom the Statute of <hi>West.</hi> 1. 34, speaks of; where was the false News or Report <hi>(dont discord, on maner de discord, on esclaunder puit surdre entre le Roy &amp; son people, ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Shall I tell you a <hi>Story</hi> or <hi>Fable,</hi> or both, after all this?</p>
            <p>The <hi>Fable</hi> speaks of a poor Idolater who had long been an earnest Supplicant, but <hi>successless Suitor</hi> to an wooden Image, to help him out of his Straits. Which not obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, his Anger at last was so kindl'd that he took up the Image by the Heels and dasht it's Head against the Wall. The Head being hollow was easily broken with the blow, and abundance of Money dropt out. Which the lately poor Votary percieving: <hi>O thou senseless perverse thing!</hi> said he (to his formerly ador'd Statue,) <hi>While I serv'd and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipt thee thou didst me no good, but hast amply rewarded me for beating and breaking thee to pieces.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He that is not concern'd with stupider things than this <hi>carved Block</hi> in the Fable, if he find not at last that they who never gave thanks for being honor'd <hi>above their merit,</hi> may in time be propitious to those who <hi>pay them no more than they deserve;</hi> I am not the first who has been mistaken in mora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lizing a Fable; nor the only Expectant who lives in hope of beholding the Scripture fulfilled, which saith, <hi>He that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buketh a man shall afterward find more favour than he that flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereth with the Tongue,</hi> Prov. 28.23. But if thus it succeeds, who sees not whether of the two, Adulation or <hi>Plain-dealing</hi> is best?</p>
            <p>The <hi>Story</hi> goes thus. Once upon a Time, while <hi>Rome</hi> was govern d by <hi>Kings,</hi> (long before <hi>the Commonwealth of England,</hi> without a <hi>King,</hi> was heard of, or seen to swarm with <hi>Sequestrators</hi> and <hi>Committee-men,</hi>) a strange, unknown old Woman, brought <hi>nine Books of Divine Oracles,</hi> as she call'd them, to <hi>Tarquinius Superbus,</hi> and exposed them to sale: But the Price demanded being thought unreasonable, <hi>Tarquinius</hi> laughed her to scorn. Which moved her to cast no less than <hi>three</hi> of them into the Fire, before his Face. After which she required as great a Price for the <hi>Residue</hi> as hefore had been set upon the whole. This done, the King
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:37307:55"/> fell into so loud a fit of laughter as had almost <hi>broken his Belly;</hi> and as soon as his Speech was recovered, said, the Woman without doubt was <hi>delirious.</hi> Immediately she burned three more, yet refused to abate a farthing of her first Price. <hi>Tarquinius,</hi> at last, admiring her Constancy, and presuming that something of extraordinary Worth was contained in the <hi>Volumes</hi> that were left, gave as much for the remaining <hi>three</hi> as at first would have purchased all the <hi>nine.</hi> A. Gell. lib. 1. c. 19.</p>
            <p>You know the time Sir! when a parcel of Books which you greatly desir'd to get into your hands, might have been your own on easier Terms than now you can hope to possess them, if ever you do. By abusing <hi>the Author</hi> you have raised the Price by <hi>two thirds</hi> at least. What there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore remains but that <hi>every one</hi> of them should now cost you as much as <hi>three,</hi> and every three no less than nine, in time past, would have stood you?</p>
            <p>To be plain and free, as all along hitherto I have been, should your <hi>stingy proposal</hi> above mention'd seem as silly and ridiculous to your selves as to me it looked as soon as it appeared, and the Terms now talked of, be accepted, it would not serve the turn. The <hi>wrong</hi> has been doubl'd, trebl'd, quadrupl'd, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> septupl'd indeed, and so must the <hi>satisfaction,</hi> if you mean to be releas'd.</p>
            <p>I could tarry much longer with you, on this occasion, but that other business calls upon me to withdraw.</p>
            <p>If I am not yet out of your debt for <hi>visiting me</hi> with <hi>Appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritors, Libels, Warrants, Constables,</hi> and such like Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, (which must otherwise and elsewhere be talk'd with,) let me know it, that another <hi>Visit</hi> may be made. For of this, which hath now been drawn out to twice or thrice the length that was once intended, you cannot be more desirous than I am to see</p>
